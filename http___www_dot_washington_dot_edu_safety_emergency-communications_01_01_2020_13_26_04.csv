http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	h1			Emergency communications
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	p			The University of Washington is committed to keeping the campus community informed during emergencies and situations that might disrupt normal operations.
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	h2			What is UW Alert?
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	p		a	UW Alert is a notification system that quickly informs the UW community about an emergency situation that poses a potential threat to people’s health and safety. UW Alert messages are sent via email and text, as well as posted on 
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	a			Facebook
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	a			Twitter 
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	p		a	and the 
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	a			UW Alert blog
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	p		a	. Incidents that prompt an alert message can include an active shooter, other violent crimes on or near campus, severe weather and hazardous materials (HazMat) responses. UW Alert messages are limited to 140 characters, so messages include a link to the 
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	a			UW Alert blog
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	p			 for more information as it becomes available.
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	h3			What is UW Advisory and how is it different from UW Alert?
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	p		a	A UW Advisory works in the same way as UW Alert, but is used to make the community aware of a significant situation that could disrupt operations but does not pose an immediate threat to health and safety. These could include power outages, phone outages that could affect 911 service, suspended campus operations and perceived threats which police have determined to be unfounded. If you sign up for UW Alert, you are automatically also subscribed for UW Advisory messages. Nearly all messages include a link to the 
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	a			emergency blog
http://www.washington.edu/safety/emergency-communications	p			 for more information.
