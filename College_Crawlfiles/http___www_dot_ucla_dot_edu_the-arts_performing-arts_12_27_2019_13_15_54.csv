http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	span			UCLA is not just a world-class academic institution, it's also a world-famous cultural and entertainment destination.
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	p			Every year more than half a million people flock to campus to take in more than a thousand visual, performing and media arts events created by both guest professionals and gifted students.
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	p			On any given evening, you'll find top-tier student productions:  classic, new and musical theater at the Freud Playhouse, including the work of the TFT Theater Lab, where students perform alongside professionals; dance at the Glorya Kaufman Dance Theater; or a joyful musical explosion at Schoenberg Hall.
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	p		a	And throughout the year, the 
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	a			Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	p			 presents contemporary, professional performing arts in every discipline. One night Royce Hall echoes with the poetry of Allen Ginsberg or the comedy of Nick Offerman. The next night, there are performances by Emmylou Harris and Her Red Dirt Boys, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Circus Oz or a compelling restaging of Eugene Ionesco's Rhinoceros.
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	p		a	In addition, the 
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	a			UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	p		a	 is closely associated with the nearby 
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	a			Geffen Playhouse
http://www.ucla.edu/the-arts/performing-arts	p			, which is acclaimed for its development of new plays.
