http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h2			Undergraduate Education
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	span			From the very first moment students step onto campus, they feel a palpable sense of momentum.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p		em	A can-do spirit  emanates from every class and student, and undergraduate students are integral to this momentum. Combine that with the resources and opportunities you would expect from one of the highest ranked schools in the nation, and it's not a question of 
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			 our students will make a difference — it's a question of when.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			Majors and Minors
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			Undergraduates can choose from 125  majors offered by the College and professional schools. And because these can be the most defining years in a student's life, deciding on a major can be just as meaningful as deciding on a university.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	span			Whatever your intellectual curiosities, hobbies or career aspirations, chances are you'll find what you're looking for at UCLA. With more than 109 academic departments, including top-ranked programs and instruction in 40 different languages, the biggest challenge you'll face is what to choose.

http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			College of Letters and Science
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			The College of Letters and Science is the overarching umbrella that encompasses the social sciences, the humanities, the physical and life sciences, and undergraduate education. It's the crossroads of perspectives, where students analyze and question. It's where they learn to think and write, both critically and creatively, about the literatures, social issues and languages of other cultures and where they're encouraged to teach us everything they can about their own.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	a			Continue to the College of Letters & Science
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			Social Sciences Division
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			The Social Sciences Division guides students toward socially, culturally and environmentally relevant thinking and action. From African American studies and political science to anthropology and communication studies, the social sciences explore how the world works. And as an institution at the forefront of progress, UCLA endows its students with the ability not only to prepare for changes in the world but to bring change about.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	a			Continue to the Division of Social Sciences
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			Humanities Division
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			Educators and writers. Linguists and literary critics. Historians and philosophers. These are only a few of the many roles students in the Humanities Division assume regularly at UCLA. And while the content may vary across disciplines, humanities students, in all of their roles, continue to analyze, theorize, write and read about the same important thing — the human condition.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	a			Continue to the Division of Humanities
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			Physical Sciences Division
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			Concrete discovery — that's what the Division of Physical Sciences is all about. From astronomy and mathematics to geophysics and chemistry, students in the physical sciences are on a perpetual quest for truth in which the biggest differences between disciplines are the methods they use and the discoveries they make.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	a			Continue to the Division of Physical Sciences
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			Life Sciences Division
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			The Division of Life Sciences is devoted to the study of living organisms. Whether they focus on ecology, genetics, cell biology or psychology, life sciences students share one thing in common: a fascination with the existence and evolution of all forms of life.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	span			With 12 different majors and six minors, the Life Sciences Division at UCLA offers insight, understanding and truths concerning the blueprints of life.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	a			Continue to the Division of Life Sciences
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			Undergraduate Education Division
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			The campus-wide general education curriculum is overseen by the Division of Undergraduate Education, which provides students with challenging and rewarding academic experiences  like Freshman Clusters, Fiat Lux Seminars, Writing II and Entrepreneurship programs. The division also offers the Academic Advancement Program, College Honors Programs and two Centers for Undergraduate Research, as well as the Center for Community Learning.

http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			School of the Arts and Architecture
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			Creating, expressing, illustrating and performing — this is just a glimpse of what happens at the School of the Arts and Architecture, where students can earn degrees in four departments. And with three internationally acclaimed institutions — the Hammer Museum, the Fowler Museum at UCLA and the Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA — and more than 100 distinguished faculty members, UCLA Arts is where culture and arts flourish at UCLA.

http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			Listen to the music: from the classical canon to synthesized tones to the folk music traditions of the world, The Herb Alpert School of Music is alive with sound. Performers, composers, teachers and scholars collaborate in innovative ways, including an intercultural improvisation ensemble that blends instruments from many traditions. Three academic departments — Ethnomusicology, Music and Musicology — offer degrees, and there's a well-regarded minor in the Music Industry.

http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			Luskin School of Public Affairs
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			The Luskin School is all about creating leaders and change agents — and now undergraduates can earn the B.A. in public affairs. Luskin School faculty focus on critical local, state and national issues. Current researchers analyze drinking water quality for the State of California and create strategies to allay the effects of gentrification on neighborhoods. Undergraduates take courses in public policy, social welfare and urban planning. An experiential capstone project takes them to Washington D.C., Sacramento or international destinations during senior year.

http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			School of Theater, Film and Television

http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			The school is pioneering a new interdisciplinary curriculum at the crossroads of film and digital entertainment, performing arts, costume design and cutting-edge research. Combined with resources like the UCLA Film and Television Archive — the second largest moving image archive in the United States — this academic experience provides students with the skills and experience they need to navigate the professional landscape, both in school and after they graduate.

http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	h3			School of Nursing
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			The highly-ranked Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center puts UCLA among the leaders in healthcare.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	span			And the UCLA School of Nursing is ranked among the top 25 nursing schools in the nation.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/undergraduate-education	p			The school's program features an innovative practice-based curriculum, and graduates are eligible for licensure immediately after they receive their diploma.
