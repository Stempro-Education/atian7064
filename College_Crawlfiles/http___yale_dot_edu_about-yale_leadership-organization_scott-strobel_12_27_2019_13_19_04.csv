http://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/scott-strobel	p			Scott Allan Strobel is the Henry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale University, a Professor of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the vice president for West Campus planning and programs and vice provost for science initiatives. He completed his graduate studies at Caltech and postdoctoral research at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
http://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/scott-strobel	p			He joined the Yale faculty in 1995 and served as department chair from 2006 to 2009. In January 2011 he began serving as the vice president for west campus planning and program development with responsibility for implementing scientific, arts, and educational efforts on the Yale West Campus. In 2004 he was awarded the Dylan Hixon Prize for teaching excellence in the Natural Sciences by Yale College, and in 2007 he received the Graduate Mentoring award from the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. He was appointed as the inaugural deputy provost for teaching and learning in 2014 with responsibility for supporting faculty pedagogy and student learning across the university with the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning.
