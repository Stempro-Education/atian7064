http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			If you're considering UCLA, you're probably looking at the top tier of schools—institutions of higher education that focus on showing how the world runs.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	span			We're decidedly different.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			At UCLA, we challenge our students to show us how the world could be. It's about fearlessly pushing forward, not because we know we can, but because we know it's the right thing to do.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			"We are home to the best of the best—the top thinkers like ""The Father of the Internet,"" Vinton Cerf; pioneering researchers like Dr. Patricia Ganz, who revolutionized breast cancer treatment; and icons like Jackie Robinson and Ralph Bunche, who refused to be satisfied with the status quo. Some may call this mindset naïveté. Or being overly optimistic. We call it essential. And it has led to 13 Nobel Laureates, 12 MacArthur Fellows, 260  Olympic medals, more than 100 NCAA titles and the list goes on and on. See for yourself..."

http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	h3			About UCLA
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			From humble beginnings to becoming the most applied-to university in the nation, UCLA has a history of rewriting it. Broad thinking and optimistic perspectives have always been our catalysts—allowing us to redefine possible time after time. In each field, across all disciplines and in every arena—greatness has become the UCLA hallmark.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p		a	Diverse, progressive and surrounded by one of the most influential cities in the world, UCLA operates on a global level. Consistently 
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	a			ranked
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			 in the top tier of national and international universities and powered by extensive resources, a renowned reputation, and most importantly, the will to make a real difference in the world—the result can be felt far beyond the campus.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			UCLA generates roughly $12.7 billion in economic activity a year to help power the Greater Los Angeles region. And an active portfolio of almost 3,000 inventions and more than 900 patents means UCLA plays a central role in shaping the world we all live in.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	span			And as a student, you can be a part of it.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	h3			Academics
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p		a	For every aspiration, we have a means. Over 3,800 courses in 109 academic departments create 
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	a			125  majors
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			 to define your academic path. The rigors are intense. The faculty is the foremost expert. And there are countless opportunities for research, community outreach and connecting with major players in almost any field.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p		a	UCLA's 
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	a			admission requirements
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			 are among the most selective in the nation. We are looking for those who can thrive at a very advanced level, therefore, we only accept students who meet our high academic standards and can demonstrate that they will be an active, valuable contributor on campus. It's a tough process.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	span			But rest assured, if you're here—you deserve to be.

http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	span			We are 4,300 strong.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p		a	We are Nobel Prize winners. We are recipients of the Fields Medal and Turing Award. We are Guggenheim fellows and Fulbright 
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	a			scholars
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			. We are leading researchers and world-renowned authorities in just about every field of study. We are the definition of passionate and are driven to effect real change in the world.

http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p		a	From Chinese linguistics to volcanic geology, we delight in the intellectual curiosity of our students, and take pride in their 
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	a			research accomplishments
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p		a	. We include them on cross-disciplinary teams, and even

http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			While the aesthetics are inspiring and unlike any you'll find elsewhere—the real beauty is what     happens on it.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			UCLA students are almost perpetually active. From starting, joining and running more than 1,000 clubs, to flourishing fraternities and sororities, to a deep involvement with the community—students here are perpetually in motion.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p		a	They start businesses and run organizations. They hone their skills and shape their futures as volunteers for 
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	a			Mobile Clinic
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	a			Bruin Consulting

http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	a			L.A. Hacks
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			. They play club sports from rugby to Quidditch, and fill the stands for some of the most storied NCAA athletic teams in history. And that is just the tip of the tip of the iceberg.

All of the residence halls are within a couple minutes walk of     each other—with classes not much farther than that. You are connected to campus, giving you every     outlet and opportunity to find your niche at UCLA. It is vibrant, exciting and unforgettable.
http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	span			Perhaps that is why 97 percent of freshmen chose to live on campus.

http://www.ucla.edu/students/prospective-students	p			With offerings from Pan-Asian cuisine to health-conscious cafes to award-winning restaurants, the one     dining option you won't find at UCLA is the stereotypical cafeteria. You can grab a wood-fired pizza at     Covel Commons, or enjoy classic American favorites in the wee hours at the De Neve Late Night.
