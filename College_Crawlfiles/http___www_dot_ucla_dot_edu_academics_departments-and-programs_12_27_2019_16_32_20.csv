http://www.ucla.edu/academics/departments-and-programs	span			There's North Campus. And there's South Campus. Together, there are nearly 150 departments and programs.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/departments-and-programs	p			UCLA fosters an expansive, multidisciplinary academic experience. Many students aren't just working for straight As in their field â€” they study across disciplines. They major in mechanical engineering and take playwriting courses. They take acting classes and study two languages.
http://www.ucla.edu/academics/departments-and-programs	span			No matter the pursuit, UCLA has the academics to start the chase.
