http://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/joan-oneill	p			Joan E. O’Neill has worked at Yale for more than thirty years. She is responsible for leadership of all the university’s alumni affairs and fundraising activities.
http://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/joan-oneill	p			Prior to her appointment as vice president for alumni affairs and development in July 2012, Ms. O’Neill spent eight years as associate vice president for development leading the major gifts, parent giving, planned giving, annual giving, and reunion giving programs, which together contributed $1.2 billion of the Yale Tomorrow campaign's total. She also provided oversight for the Information services division of the Development Office and was the primary liaison to most of Yale’s school and unit development organizations. During the 2004-2005 academic year she served as acting vice president for development. In this role she was instrumental in planning and designing the strategy for the Yale Tomorrow campaign, which concluded in 2011 having raised $3.88 billion. In 2015 she assumed responsibility for alumni affairs in addition to development. Ms. O’Neill held earlier positions as area director at the Yale School of Medicine, as director of special projects and assistant to the vice president for development, as director of leadership and major gifts, and as a director in principal gifts for Yale’s previous capital campaign, which concluded in 1997. She first joined Yale in 1987 as a major gift officer.
http://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/joan-oneill	p			Ms. O’Neill received a B.A. in psychology from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
