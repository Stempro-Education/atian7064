http://www.ucla.edu/about	h2			Overview
http://www.ucla.edu/about	span			For nearly 100 years, ucla has been a pioneer, persevering through impossibility, turning the futile into the attainable.
http://www.ucla.edu/about	span			14 Nobel Laureates, 15 MacArthur Fellows, 118 NCAA Titles, 261 olympic medals, more than 140 companies created based on UCLA-founded technology
http://www.ucla.edu/about	p			We doubt the critics, reject the status quo and see opportunity in dissatisfaction. Our campus, faculty and students are driven by optimism. It is not naïve; it is essential. And it has fueled every accomplishment, allowing us to redefine what's possible, time after time.
http://www.ucla.edu/about	p			This can-do perspective has brought us 14 Nobel Prizes, 14 faculty MacArthur Fellows, 118 NCAA titles and more Olympic medals than most nations. Our faculty and alumni helped create the Internet and pioneered reverse osmosis. And more than 140 companies have been created based on technology developed at UCLA.
http://www.ucla.edu/about	p			What inspires MacArthur Fellows and Rhodes Scholars? What gave Jackie Robinson the courage to become the first African American in Major League Baseball? What was the catalyst that spurred Vint Cerf and Leonard Kleinrock's dream of the Internet?
http://www.ucla.edu/about	span			The answer is optimism. And it is in our DNA.
http://www.ucla.edu/about	p			It is what enables us to push forward and redefine what's possible. It pervades our focus on education, research and service and, in turn, opens limitless opportunities to every student.
http://www.ucla.edu/about	span			And through its eye-opening lens, we see beyond the classroom, allowing us to engage with the world right now.
http://www.ucla.edu/about	p			As UCLA moves onward, we leverage our history to define our future. Every achievement and breakthrough we have made justifies our optimism, calling us to build upon our past. And as we near the end of a century of excellence, we steadfastly pursue future endeavors with the same optimism that brought us here. 
http://www.ucla.edu/about	span		br	This is UCLA.
http://www.ucla.edu/about	span			These are the grounds of optimism.
