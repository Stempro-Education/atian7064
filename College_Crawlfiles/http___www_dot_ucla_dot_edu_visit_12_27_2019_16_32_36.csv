http://www.ucla.edu/visit	p			Nothing written here can compare with actually stepping on campus. There really aren't words to describe the aura of optimism that bubbles from every twist and turn of our inspiring campus. There is no substitute for speaking to the students and faculty, and the feeling you get that not only can we make tomorrow better—we will.
http://www.ucla.edu/visit	p			You have to experience UCLA to understand it. You have to feel the activity while strolling through the center of campus—alive with 1,000  clubs and organizations. You have to step inside the labs and libraries, studios and classrooms. If you can't visit in person, spend a little time with the Virtual Tour.
http://www.ucla.edu/visit	a			Launch the Virtual Tour
http://www.ucla.edu/visit	p			And if you're new to Los Angeles, don't forget to explore our global city. From Rodeo Drive to Sunset Boulevard to the world famous beaches of Santa Monica and Malibu, you can experience everything from natural wonders to premier shopping, sample every kind of food and enjoy arts and events in the entertainment capital of the world.
