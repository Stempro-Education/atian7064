http://www.ucla.edu/parents-and-families	p		a	From the bustling energy of Bruin Walk to the glorious vista from Janss Steps — the UCLA campus is beautiful. But what really inspires your child and forges their character is our uniquely diverse environment. UCLA is alive with a wealth of cultures, ethnicities, perspectives and experiences. From classrooms, labs and libraries to more than
