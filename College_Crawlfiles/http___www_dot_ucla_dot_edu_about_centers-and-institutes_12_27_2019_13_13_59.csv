http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	p		a	Research centers and institutes are among the most important ways UCLA encourages collaboration across disciplines. Interdisciplinary research units are highlighted on the 
http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	a			Organized Research Unit website
http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	p		a	. There are hundreds of other 
http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	a			active centers, institutes and labs across campus
http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	p			, many with ties to other institutions and active community programs. This page highlights a small sampling.
http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	h3			Environment and Sustainability
http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	p			On campus, across the city and around the world, UCLA pursues advances in the field of environment and sustainability. The Luskin Center for Innovation, the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, and the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability provide leadership and a nexus of research innovation. Inspired and informed by their work, UCLA uses the campus as a living laboratory of sustainability. The Sustainable LA Grand Challenge organizes more than 200 experts across 40 departments to achieve one ambitious goal: Transition Los Angeles County toward 100-percent renewable energy, 100-percent local water, and enhanced ecosystem and human health by 2050.

http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	span			UCLA operates with a global approach.
http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	p			Because international experience is integral to a world-class education, the UCLA International Institute fosters global perspectives through majors in global studies, international development studies and international and area studies, several minors and graduate programs, and international internships. The institute’s more than 25 multidisciplinary centers promote innovative research and host numerous public events on diverse world regions and global topics. And the institute both brings dignitaries, politicians, scholars and artists to campus and represents UCLA to the world. Hundreds of institute-affiliated faculty inform news coverage and make UCLA an authority in policy, teaching and research on global issues.

http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	p			Just as UCLA celebrates diversity across campus, its Institute of American Cultures fosters ethnic studies scholarship and research. The institute is a collaborative initiative among the four ethnic studies centers on campus — the American Indian Studies Center, the Asian American Studies Center, the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies and the Chicano Studies Research Center.

http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	p			Stem cell research is a revolutionary opportunity to explore and understand the nature and behavior of stem cells and use that knowledge to treat human disease. The Broad Stem Cell Research Center is on the cusp of transforming patient care by developing personalized stem-cell-based therapies.
http://www.ucla.edu/about/centers-and-institutes	p			The Center’s Dr. Donald Kohn has developed novel approaches for genetic blood diseases. His clinical trials for adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency, an immune disorder also known as ADA-SCID or bubble baby disease, have cured 30 out of 30 babies over the past eight years.
