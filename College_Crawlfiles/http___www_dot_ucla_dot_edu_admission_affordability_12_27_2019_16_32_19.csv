http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	h2			Affordability and How Financial Aid Can Help
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	span			"""How To Afford UCLA"""
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			When you are admitted to UCLA, you and your family might have a lot of questions about how you’ll cover the costs of tuition, housing and other necessities. Our financial aid professionals will make every effort to help you afford to pay for your education. Our office is dedicated to helping each family create a strategy that works for them. Thanks to the numerous options available, your education can be affordable.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	span			The No. 1 Best Value University
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p		em	In 2018, 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	em			Forbes
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			 ranked UCLA the No. 1 best value university, citing our combination of high education quality and low student debt upon graduation.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p		a	Most families pay less than the full price, and 46 percent of our undergraduate students pay no tuition at all. We offer an array of 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			housing options
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p		a	 and 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			meal plans
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p		a	 — as well as financial aid for housing — so that you have flexibility as to how much you pay for room and board. In addition, UCLA offers 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			payment plans
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			 for both tuition and housing so that families can make smaller, regular payments throughout the academic year instead of larger payments.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	h3			ESTIMATED COSTS FOR THE ACADEMIC YEAR 2019-20

http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p		a	 or the 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			DREAM Act Application
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			. Make sure that you complete the application before the UCLA priority deadline (March 2). These applications provide access to federal- and state-based financial aid programs for all eligible students.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Continue to FAFSA
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Continue to DREAM Act
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	span			Four Types of Financial Aid
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			Paying for your education should be a partnership between student, family and university. Check out the many ways you can pay for your UCLA education.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	h3			1. Scholarships
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			UCLA offers financial support that may be awarded based on need, academic merit, background, specific talents or professional interests:
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			UCLA Regents Scholarships (merit-based)
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			UCLA Alumni Scholarships (merit-based)
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			UCLA Achievement Scholarships (merit- plus need-based)
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			Some other important scholarship resources include:
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	li		a	Searchable scholarship databases: 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Fastweb
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			College Board
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	li		a	 and 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Sallie Mae
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			UCLA Scholarship Resource Center
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	li			: This unique center for current UCLA students helps you identify available scholarships, regardless of income level. Services include counseling and workshops.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			Don’t forget to check organizations in your hometown, such as the Rotary Club and AmeriCorps, that offer scholarships for community service.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	h3			2. Grants
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			Grants are awards that the recipient does not have to repay. Sources include the federal and state governments, as well as UCLA. Most are awarded based on need and require submission of the Financial Aid Application by March 2.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	strong			Available to California residents only
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			University of California Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Cal Grants (FAFSA or DREAM Act and GPA verification due March 2)
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Middle Class Scholarship Program (MCSP)
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	strong			Available to U.S. residents
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Pell Grants (Federal)
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (Federal)
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			University Student Aid Program Funds (need-based)
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	strong			University Grants
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			: These need-based grants demonstrate UCLA’s commitment to affordability. Recipients must complete and submit the FAFSA or DREAM Act Application annually by March 2.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	em			Please note
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			: Financial aid supported by funds from the State of California is not available to nonresident students enrolling at UCLA. However, the UCLA Financial Aid and Scholarships office will assist nonresident domestic students with federal financial aid, private loans, advice on scholarships and merit-based aid, where available.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	h3			3. Student Loans
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			In 2018, graduating seniors in the U.S. had an average student loan debt of over $29,800. But for UCLA seniors, the average was much lower — just over $22,390. And virtually all UCLA graduates — 98% of them — successfully manage loan repayment.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	b		a	The federal government offers low-interest 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Federal Direct Student Loans
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	b			 for higher education.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			There are flexible payment options and other discounts, as well as delayed repayment options. Interest paid on student loans is tax-deductible.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	h3			4. Part-time Student Jobs
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p		a	Having a part-time job can help pay for textbooks and day-to-day living expenses. Last year, more than 9,500 UCLA undergraduates worked on campus part time. Some had 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			work-study awards
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			, which can make it easier to find a position on campus or off.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	h3			What Parents Can Do
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			Parents have access to a number of resources, including some that offer tax benefits.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	strong			Parent Loans
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			Parents may take out low-interest education loans from the government and private loans from banks or other lenders. The terms for federal loans to parents are determined by the Department of Education; they are not based on credit scores. Loan payments can be postponed until after the student graduates. Interest paid on parent loans is tax-deductible.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	strong			Savings Accounts and Tax Benefits
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p		a	Some families set up special college savings accounts, such as 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			Coverdell Education Savings Accounts
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p		a	 and 
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	a			529 plans
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			, which enable them to put away money for college tuition and related expenses.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			Families can also withdraw money from their 401(k) or 403(b) retirement savings accounts. Withdrawals are penalty-free when the money is used to pay for education.
http://www.ucla.edu/admission/affordability	p			The government offers tax benefits and credits for higher education. For details, check your tax preparation software or ask your tax preparer.
