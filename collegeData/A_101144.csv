http://www.seminary.edu	h1			Why Northern?
http://www.seminary.edu	span			Seminary education has a vital role to play in the advancement of God’s Kingdom. As the world continues to change, the need for transformational leadership has grown. To effectively meet this need, the Church must raise up leaders who have a firm grasp, both in theory and in practice, of God’s mission on earth. Have you considered this growing need?
http://www.seminary.edu	a			Why is Seminary Important?
http://www.seminary.edu	h1			richly diverse
http://www.seminary.edu	p			Since 1913, Northern Seminary has welcomed men and women from various Christian faith traditions, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and ministry experiences. Our students have enrolled from almost 30 denominations, and alumni have served in over 30 countries. Our students also range in age from recent college graduates to second career and retirees who have answered a call to ministry.
http://www.seminary.edu	a			About Northern
http://www.seminary.edu	h1			Not Just theoretical
http://www.seminary.edu	p		a	All of our 
http://www.seminary.edu	a			faculty
http://www.seminary.edu	p			 have been called to ministry at some point in their lives, and their teaching reflects that calling. In fact, many still serve in churches or para-church ministries. Students can trust that members of our faculty are aware of the challenges and rewards of ministry because they have experienced them firsthand.
http://www.seminary.edu	a			Our Faculty
http://www.seminary.edu	h1			Missional and holistic
http://www.seminary.edu	p		a	Focused on the Mission of God, Northern provides an 
http://www.seminary.edu	a			education
http://www.seminary.edu	p			 that brings together the best of theory and practice. Powerful ministry is based on an understanding of your ministry context and your ability to apply your knowledge.

http://www.seminary.edu	span			As the need for seminary increases, so does the need for a renewed approach to Theological Education.
