http://www.villanova.edu/villanova/admission/overview/deadlines.html	p			Maybe itâs the rigorous academics and personalized learning. Maybe itâs the Augustinian Catholic guideposts of truth, unity and love. Maybe itâs the 250,000 hours of annual community service. Or maybe itâs the whole package of distinctive features that makes Villanova a special placeâa place that stands out and stands apart; a place that attracts students who want to think critically, act compassionately and succeed while serving others.

http://www.villanova.edu/villanova/law/admissions/applyvls.html	span			Villanova Law accepts non-matriculated students for a year or a semester depending on an applicant's situation. Applicants applying to visit for the academic year typically begin their studies in the fall. However, in certain circumstances, applicants may be allowed to begin their studies in the spring semester. As a non-matriculated student, credits taken at Villanova will be applied to the degree requirements of your current law school, and the degree will be awarded by that school.

This letter should state you have permission to attend Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law as a visiting non-matriculated student, that you will be awarded credit for taking classes at Villanova Law, and what academic conditions, if any, will apply to you while attending Villanova Law. This letter should also indicate that there are no disciplinary actions either pending or expected to be brought against you.

http://www.villanova.edu/villanova/law/admissions/applyvls.html	span			You must submit a separate application to the Villanova University MBA Program during the spring semester of your 1L year. The MBA Program requires that you take the GMAT; however, in certain cases, the GMAT may be waived if you achieve a qualifying score on the LSAT. It is recommended that students who are interested in the joint program take the GMAT before entering law school. Given the rigors of the first year, it is not advisable to spend time studying for the GMAT.

Students cannot take MPA classes during their first year in Law School, so they need to work with Graduate Studies in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to take a leave or postpone their MPA studies for one academic year if they are accepted into the JD/MPA program. Alternatively, JD students may apply to the MPA program in the second semester of their enrollment in the JD program. While it is possible to start the JD program before taking MPA courses, it is not possible to start the MPA program before taking JD classes. MPA applications should be submitted by
