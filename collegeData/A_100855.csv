The assessment must be in narrative form and include recommendations for any treatment (psychotherapy or medication) the psychologist finds necessary for the student to function independently in a campus setting.
http://www.lesley.edu/admissions-aid/how-to-apply/threshold-program	p			The goal is to address emotional, behavioral, and social issues that might influence the fit between the student’s needs and the program’s ability to meet those needs. The choice of instruments (the tests listed above) depends on the psychologist’s knowing the student’s cognitive abilities and using appropriate techniques for that student.
