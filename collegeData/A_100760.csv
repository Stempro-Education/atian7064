http://www.admissions.iastate.edu/apply/online	a			Is it true that I can choose to self-report my academic information on my admission application instead of requesting that my high school send an official copy of my transcript?
http://www.admissions.iastate.edu/apply/online	a			Why do you give students the opportunity to self-report their academic information?  
http://www.admissions.iastate.edu/apply/online	a			Does this mean Iowa State’s freshman admission requirements have changed?
http://www.admissions.iastate.edu/apply/online	a			What happens if I was admitted based on my self-reported academic information, but my final transcript shows I do not meet Iowa State’s freshman admission requirements?
http://www.admissions.iastate.edu/apply/online	a			What about my ACT or SAT scores - do they still need to be sent to the Admissions Office?
http://www.admissions.iastate.edu/apply/online	a			Are other types of applicants (e.g., transfer, international, graduate) permitted to self-report their academic information instead of submitting an official transcript?
