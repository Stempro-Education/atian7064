https://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	h1			   Welcome to Iona College’s Online Application Process
https://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	p			   We’re pleased that you have decided to apply to Iona College. With highly regarded academic programs, a supportive community and dedicated faculty, Iona is a great choice for today’s motivated students. You’re taking the first step in an exciting process: one that may change your life and prepare you to move the world.
https://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	h2			   Applications reviewed holistically. SAT/ACT optional.
https://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	p		strong	   Iona College is a close-knit community of scholars who believe in the liberating power of education. At Iona, students are more than just a number, and we are committed to every individual student’s success. We review each student’s application holistically, considering high school transcript, recommendations of teachers and counselors and a student’s overall record of achievement. 
https://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	strong			An SAT or ACT score is not required to be considered for admission.
https://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	p			 Our holistic review allows us to make admissions decisions and program recommendations to best fit each student, be it the increased academic rigor of the Honors program, additional supports of the College Assistance Program (CAP), or the multi-faceted benefits of Iona’s living and learning communities.
https://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	p			   Iona programs that require a separate application, such as dual degree programs with the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine and Seton Hall University of Law, or early guaranteed entry to Iona’s CSD graduate program will be required to submit SAT or ACT scores for admission. Additionally, all Division 1 athletes will need to submit an SAT or ACT score, per NCAA regulations.

http://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	h1			   Welcome to Iona College’s Online Application Process
http://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	p			   We’re pleased that you have decided to apply to Iona College. With highly regarded academic programs, a supportive community and dedicated faculty, Iona is a great choice for today’s motivated students. You’re taking the first step in an exciting process: one that may change your life and prepare you to move the world.
http://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	h2			   Applications reviewed holistically. SAT/ACT optional.
http://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	p		strong	   Iona College is a close-knit community of scholars who believe in the liberating power of education. At Iona, students are more than just a number, and we are committed to every individual student’s success. We review each student’s application holistically, considering high school transcript, recommendations of teachers and counselors and a student’s overall record of achievement. 
http://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	strong			An SAT or ACT score is not required to be considered for admission.
http://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	p			 Our holistic review allows us to make admissions decisions and program recommendations to best fit each student, be it the increased academic rigor of the Honors program, additional supports of the College Assistance Program (CAP), or the multi-faceted benefits of Iona’s living and learning communities.
http://www.iona.edu/admissions/apply-online.aspx	p			   Iona programs that require a separate application, such as dual degree programs with the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine and Seton Hall University of Law, or early guaranteed entry to Iona’s CSD graduate program will be required to submit SAT or ACT scores for admission. Additionally, all Division 1 athletes will need to submit an SAT or ACT score, per NCAA regulations.
