https://www.thiel.edu/admissions/apply-online	h2			Application Instructions and Requirements
https://www.thiel.edu/admissions/apply-online	p			Thiel College does not have a minimum grade point average or standardized test score needed for admission, as each student is evaluated on their own academic, extracurricular and social merits.
