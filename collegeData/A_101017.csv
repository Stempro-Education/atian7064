http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	p			 The candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment and the consistent, prompt completion of all responsibilities and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. The candidate must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, effective interpersonal skills, willingness and ability to function as an effective team player, and interest and motivation to learn are all personal qualities required during the educational process.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	p			Candidates are required to certify that they understand and meet these Technical Standards. Candidates must provide such certification prior to matriculation. Candidates who may not meet the Technical Standards must inform the Director of Admissions, who will then contact the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students, in consultation with the academic dean, will identify and discuss what accommodations, if any, the College would need to make that would allow the candidate to complete the curriculum. The College is not able to grant accommodations that alter the educational standards of the curriculum. Students must meet the Technical Standards for the duration of enrollment in their professional program.

http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	p			Before an invitation is issued to attend an on-campus interview, applicants must meet the admission requirements listed previously. After the Office of Admissions receives all required application materials, applicant files are reviewed to determine whether an applicant merits an invitation for an interview.

Each interviewee will meet with at least two interviewers. Applications will be evaluated on verbal communication skills, understanding of the optometry profession, commitment to patient care, and other elements as determined by the College.

http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	p			All requests for application withdrawal must be made in writing.

http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	p			AZCOPT may elect to accept transfer students from other U.S. accredited schools of optometry who are currently enrolled, are in good academic standing, and provide acceptable reason(s) for seeking transfer. Typically, students will transfer at the beginning of the second year of the curriculum.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	p			Students requesting transfers must meet the College's general requirements for admission. They must also submit the following:
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	li			A letter to the Director of Admissions outlining the reasons for requesting a transfer and explaining any difficulties encountered at the previous institution(s)
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	li			Course syllabi for all optometry coursework for which advanced standing credit is requested
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	li			Official scores from the OAT, MCAT, DAT, PCAT, or GRE.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	li			Official transcripts from all schools attended: undergraduate, graduate, and professional
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	li			A letter from the dean of the college in which the student is enrolled that describes current academic status and terms of withdrawal or dismissal
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	li			Additional documents or letters of recommendation as determined necessary by the Director of Admissions or Dean.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	p			Following receipt of these materials, a decision by the Dean is made regarding whether or not the student merits an on-campus interview. If the student receives an invitation, he/she interviews with an appropriate interview team. The interview team then makes an admissions recommendation to the Dean who approves both the student's admissions status and class standing.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-optometry-in-glendale.xml	p			The transfer application must be received sufficiently early to allow for processing of the application, interview, and moving of the student prior to the start of the next academic term.

http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	h3			Technical Standards for Admission
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			The technical standards for admission set forth by MWU-CPG outline the nonacademic abilities considered essential for students to achieve the level of competence required by the faculty and by the ACPE, the pharmacy-accrediting agency, in order to obtain the Pharm.D. degree.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			A candidate must have abilities and skills in five areas: 1) observation; 2) communication; 3) motor; 4) intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative; and 5) behavioral and social. Technological compensation can be made for some limitation in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	strong			I. Observation:
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			 The candidate must be able to accurately make observations at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation and is enhanced by the functional use of all of the other senses.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	strong			II. Communication:
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			 The candidate must be able to communicate effectively, efficiently, and sensitively in both oral and written form and be able to perceive nonverbal communication.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	strong			III. Motor:
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			 Candidates must be able to coordinate both gross and fine muscular movements, maintain equilibrium, and have functional use of the senses of touch and vision. The candidate must possess sufficient postural control, neuromuscular control, and eye-to-hand coordination to perform profession-specific skills and tasks.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	strong			IV. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities:
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			 The candidate must be able to problem solve, measure, calculate, reason, analyze, record, and synthesize large amounts of information in a timely manner. The candidate must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and understand spatial relationships.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	strong			V. Behavioral and Social Attributes:
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			 The candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment; the consistent, prompt completion of all responsibilities, and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. The candidate must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, effective interpersonal skills, willingness and ability to function as an effective team player, interest and motivation to learn are all personal qualities required during the educational process.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			Candidates are required to certify that they understand and meet these technical standards. Candidates must provide such certification prior to matriculation. Candidates who may not meet the technical standards must inform the Director of Admissions, who will then contact the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students, in consultation with the Dean, will identify and discuss what accommodations, if any, the College would need to make that would allow the candidate to complete the curriculum. Students must meet the technical standards for the duration of enrollment in their professional program.

http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			MWU-CPG uses a two-step application process. Applicants must submit a completed PharmCAS application and meet both the PharmCAS application deadline and MWU-CPG file completion deadline.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	h3			PharmCAS Application
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p		a	Applicants must apply via the online 
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	a			PharmCAS application
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			, which is usually available in July of the academic year preceding the year in which applicants plan to matriculate. Please refer to the PharmCAS application instructions for specific details about completing PharmCAS applications, required documents, and processing time. Applicants who have taken coursework or earned degrees from foreign institutions must also submit to PharmCAS an evaluation of their transcripts from an approved foreign transcript evaluation service (See Admission Requirements).
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			The deadline for submitting the PharmCAS application is March 1st. In addition to the online application and application fee, applicants are strongly encouraged to forward official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended to PharmCAS by the March 1st date. PharmCAS will not consider an application complete and will not begin the verification process until all official transcripts have been received.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			Due to the large number of applications and the limited number of seats available, students are encouraged to complete their PharmCAS applications and complete their MWU-CPG file early in the cycle. MWU-CPG will consider completed applications on a first-come, first-served basis until all seats are filled.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	h3			Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT)
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p		a	Applicants must arrange for sending scores directly from the PCAT to PharmCAS using PCAT code 104. MWU-CPG will only accept test scores received directly from PharmCAS. (See Admission Requirements for more details). PCAT scores sent directly to the Office of Admissions will not be accepted. This exam is offered by Pearson Assessment, 800-622-3231 [Call: 800-622-3231] , 
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	a			www.pcatweb.info
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			. The exam is typically offered four times per year. Only test scores earned no more than 5 years prior to the planned enrollment year are accepted.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	h3			Letters of Recommendation
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			Applicants must submit two letters of recommendation from two professionals directly to PharmCAS. MWU-CPG will only accept letters received directly from PharmCAS. It is preferred that one letter be written by a college professor who has actually taught the applicant or a prehealth advisory committee, science professor, or a health professional who knows the applicant well. Please refer to the PharmCAS application instructions for specific guidelines and requirements for submitting letters of recommendation.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	h3			Completed Applications
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			All application materials, including the PharmCAS application, verification of transcripts by PharmCAS, PCAT scores (as reported to PharmCAS), and two letters of recommendation (submitted to PharmCAS), must be received in the Office of Admissions by April 1st. Only completed applications received by the Office of Admissions on or before the deadline date will be reviewed for potential entrance into the College.

http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	h3			On-Campus Interview
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			The Director of Admissions and the Admissions Committee review applicant files when complete and use GPA and PCAT scores to determine applicant eligibility for interviews. Invitations are sent to eligible applicants for on-campus interviews, which are scheduled on a first-call, first-scheduled basis. No interviews will be granted until an individual's application process is complete.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			During the interview process, applicants will meet with an interview panel that may consist of pharmacy faculty members, pharmacists, and pharmacy students. Panel members will evaluate professional motivation and preparedness, personal qualities, communication skills, and decision-making ability by rating applicants on a standardized evaluation scale. After reviewing the applicant's completed application and interview evaluation, the Admissions Committee recommends accepting, denying, or placing applicants on an alternate list. Recommendations are then forwarded to the Dean for final approval.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			Applications to MWU-CPG are processed and reviewed during regular intervals in the admissions cycle until the class is filled.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			The PharmD program at MWU-CPG is rigorous and challenging. The Admissions Committee will therefore assess the quality and rigor of the pre-pharmacy academic records presented by applicants. When assessing the pre-pharmacy academic records, the Admissions Committee will:
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	li			View applicants with cumulative and science grade point averages below 2.75 on a 4.00 scale with particular concern. Although 2.50 on a 4.00 scale is the preferred minimum cumulative and science GPA for admission consideration, higher cumulative GPAs are more competitive and recommended. The average overall and science GPAs of applicants admitted in 2015 were 3.27 and 3.18, respectively, on a 4.00 scale.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	li			View component and composite PCAT scores below the 50th percentile with particular concern although there are no minimum PCAT scores. The average composite PCAT score of applicants admitted in 2015 was in the 76th percentile.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	li			View with concern those applicants who include pre-pharmacy math and science coursework that was completed longer than 10 years ago. More recent (within five years) pre-pharmacy math and science coursework is preferred.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	li			Consider the reputations for quality and rigor of the institutions where applicants have taken coursework, the extent of completion of science prerequisites, the credit load carried per term, the difficulty level of previous coursework, and trends in applicant grades.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	a			Reapplication Process
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			After receiving either denial or end-of-cycle letters, applicants may reapply to MWUâ€“CPG for the next enrollment cycle. Before reapplying, however, applicants should seek the advice of an admissions counselor.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			To initiate the reapplication process, applicants must submit new applications to PharmCAS. Applications are then processed by the standard application procedures.

http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	li			Additional documents or letters of recommendation as determined necessary by the Director of Admissions or Dean.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			The Office of Admissions will collect and forward students portfolios to the Office of the Dean for review. When reviews are positive, candidates will be invited for interviews with the Admissions Committee. The Committee will provide recommendations to the Dean.
http://www.midwestern.edu/admissions/apply/doctor-of-pharmacy-in-glendale.xml	p			When transferring students are admitted and request advanced standing, the Office of the Dean will forward these student requests to the appropriate faculty. No advanced standing credit will be awarded for professional pharmacy coursework completed at a foreign college of pharmacy.

Completed readmission applications must be submitted by February 15th to the Office of the Dean. The completed application of reapplying PS-1 students will be forwarded to the Admissions Committee for review and recommendation. The completed application of a reapplying PS-2 or PS-3 student will be forwarded by the Office of the Dean to the Student Promotion and Graduation Committee for review and recommendations. The respective committees will review applications for evidence of improved academic potential. Committee recommendations are forwarded to the Dean for final action.
