https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			PC Background: 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		Outside of a short hiatus in 2009, I have been a member of the PC community since 2004.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			What’s your favorite PC memory?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 I have seen the College add sports, buildings, and programs. Plus, I was even present for the rare complete solar eclipse. I have experienced many big moments at PC, but one of my favorites was donning the Scotty the Scotsman costume and walking through campus, high-fiving students.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			What is the coolest thing you have ever done?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 Does staying up past 9 p.m. count?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			If there was a book about your life, what would the title be?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 Coffee. It’s what’s for breakfast.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			What’s your hidden talent?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 Analogies.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up? 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		American Gladiator. Dallas Cowboy. Paleontologist.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			What’s your best advice for students during their college search? 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		Relax. There are more than 5,000 colleges and universities in the United States, and I guarantee that you will be admitted and love more than one of them.

https://apply.presby.edu/apply	h4	h3		Admission Counselor
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	b			Hometown:
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	h4		 Cairo, Egypt / Augusta, Georgia
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	b			PC Background:
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 I was a Political Science and French double major with a minor in International Studies. I was the president of French Club during my sophomore, junior and senior years of college, and the president of Fellowship of Christian Athletes my senior year. Also, I was a French tutor all 4 years, worked in the library all 4 years, studied abroad in Paris for a semester, and interned at PC’s Office of International Programs.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	b			What’s your favorite PC memory?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 That’s a tough one. One of my favorites is sitting on the floor with my best friends, eating our very first home-cooked meal together, and making each other laugh ‘till we cried.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	b			What is the coolest thing you have ever done?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 I went ice-skating ON the Eiffel Tower when I was studying abroad in Paris.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	b			If there was a book about your life, what would the title be?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 “It’s like Wassup but Wasim – A Guide to the Unexplainable Word Choices of Wasim Gendi.” I apparently say many things that don’t make sense.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	b			What’s your best advice for students during their college search?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 Be yourself. Don’t write down what you think colleges want you to be. Be open and honest about who you are and what you believe in. Colleges want to get to know you as a person, not just as a test-taker.

https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 An English and a political science major, a two-year choir president, a member of Cantare and the PC Chamber Choir, a Stirling, an intramural supervisor, and a member of Big Brothers Big Sisters program with Thornwell — I was a busy Blue Hose but loved every minute of it.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 Class on the front steps of Neville.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			What is your hidden talent? 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		Believe it or not, I’m a pretty good cook. You haven’t lived until you’ve tried my Saturday breakfast.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			Favorite TV show? 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	i	strong		The Office
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p	i	 takes the top spot for my favorite comedy. 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	i			Game of Thrones
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p	i	 is my current number one for drama, but 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	i			Breaking Bad
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p	i	 and 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	i			Mad Men
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 are a close second and third.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			When you were a kid, who did you wanna be when you grew up? 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		Michael “The GOAT” Jordan.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			If there was a book about your life, what would it be titled? 
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		They Call Me “The Sock Guy.”
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		Whether it’s a professor, a staff member, a current student, or an alumnus or alumna, be sure to interact with as many people as you can throughout your college search. Hearing their stories will certainly help guide you to your collegiate home.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	h3			Britt Shisler
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	h4		 Jamestown, NC
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			Why PC?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 Higher education has always been important to me. I received my BA in English from a small private liberal arts college, where the importance and value of a liberal arts education were evident. During my job search, I fell in love with PC and its values, morals, and traditions. I felt at home from the moment I stepped on campus.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			Favorite Netflix show?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 Friday Night Lights. I am a HUGE football fan. I get goosebumps thinking about football season and all that it encompasses.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			Favorite country you have visited?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 In college, I was afforded the opportunity to travel to several countries. I will tell you, Berlin, Germany is by far my favorite place I have visited, followed closely by London, England. Studying abroad in college gives you the hands-on experience, takes you outside the textbook, and exposes you to many different cultures. I encourage you to spend time traveling our beautiful world if you are given the opportunity.
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	strong			What’s your best advice for students during their college search?
https://apply.presby.edu/apply	p	p		 Visit several different colleges and universities to get a feel for the uniqueness of each campus. Step outside the box and look for hidden, unique opportunities. Be sure to seek a place that will provide a liberal arts education that develops critical thinkers and pushes them from a fixed-mindset to a growth-mindset. Also, keep an open mind as you tour the campus, and you will find that special place meant just for you.

http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	label			Test-Optional FAQs
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	strong			Why does Presbyterian College offer a test-optional policy?
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	p			At the core of Presbyterian College’s mission lies a belief in the power of the liberal arts and the development of the whole student, including mind, body, and soul. Thus, it is only fitting that we in the Office of Admission have always taken a holistic approach to reviewing applicants, focusing on the many strengths of a student, not just a student’s ACT or SAT scores. This approach, paired with our internal and external research surrounding factors correlating with academic potential, yielded a decision to move toward the offering of a test-optional admission policy to students seeking admission to the College. Now, applicants can use their performance in the classroom to showcase academic achievement and academic potential.
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	strong			How do I know if test-optional is right for me?
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	p			Do you feel as if your test scores are an accurate reflection of your academic ability? If so, applying test-optional probably isn’t for you. However, if you feel that your performance in your high school coursework is a better reflection of your academic ability than your ACT or SAT scores, you can choose not to include your test scores in the admission process.
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	strong			Are there any students who cannot apply test-optional?
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	p			There are three groups of students who cannot apply test-optional:
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	li			             Per NCAA mandate, prospective student athletes must submit test scores for athletic eligibility.         
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	li			             Homeschooled students must submit test scores for admission purposes.         
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	li			             International students are required to submit standardized test scores in order to demonstrate proficiency in the English language.         
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	strong			How will PC review my application if I don’t submit my test scores?
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	p			Seeing that the Office of Admission uses the holistic approach to reviewing applicants, the process of reviewing test-optional applicants and non-test-optional applicants is quite similar. In regard to academics, the Admission Committee will evaluate a test-optional applicant’s academic record, including grades, strength of high school curriculum, as well as his or her overall grade trend. Letters of recommendation, writing ability, community involvement, and other achievements will also be considered.
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	strong			Will I still qualify for merit scholarships if I apply test-optional?
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	p			Yes, you will still be eligible for the College’s merit scholarships, which are awarded based on a student’s academic performance, leadership ability, writing ability, and commitment to service.
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	strong			If I decide to be a Blue Hose, will I need to submit my test scores?
http://www.presby.edu/admissions/apply-to-pc	p			Yes. After you enroll at Presbyterian College, you will be asked to submit your ACT and/or SAT scores for advising and placement purposes.
