https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	h3			 by Rebecca Hill
https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	span		em	In her new book, 
https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	span		em	, Rebecca Basdeo Hill examines the connection between the glory of YHWH and the holiness of YHWH in the book of Ezekiel. Focusing primarily on Ezekiel’s three major visions found in chapters 1-3, 8-11, and 40-48, Dr. Hill unveils the beauty of YHWH’s glory and holiness. She develops and proposes a Pentecostal hermeneutic of ‘seeing’ and ‘hearing’ as a critically informed and appropriate strategy for biblical interpretation. The conclusion of this research states that (1) the presence and absence of YHWH is the presence and absence of YHWH’s holiness; (2) an encounter with the glory of YHWH is an encounter with the holiness of YHWH; (3) the glory and holiness of YHWH depict the sovereignty and power of YHWH; (4) experiencing the glory and holiness of YHWH require seeing and hearing the word of YHWH; (5) the Spirit of YHWH gives access to YHWH’s holy presence; (6) disregarding the holiness of YHWH and the holy things of YHWH is a willful breach of the glorious presence of YHWH; (7) YHWH will depart when we violate YHWH’s holy splendor; (8) YHWH manifests his glory and holiness in his judgment of us; (9) YHWH demonstrates his glory and holiness in his salvation and love for us; and (10) YHWH’s holy presence is immediate, near, and universal.

https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	span		span	 tells the remarkable story of Margaretha Adriana Alt, the mother of the Indonesian Pentecostal Mission. Beginning with her origins in the Netherlands, conversion experience, early training in music and nursing, and her romantic relationship, van der Laan traces her journey to Indonesia. Surrendering fully to the call of God upon her life, she cancels her engagement to be married and devotes her life to caring for those on the margins of society. Experiencing Spirit baptism, Alt becomes an early and very influential leader in the burgeoning Pentecostal movement, where she would encounter obstacles to and prejudices against women in ministry. Her ministry would include the establishment of orphanages, Christian communities, schools, imprisonment, publishing, poetry and hymnody, as well as considerable evangelistic work. The use of period photography helps to tell this compelling story of this most extraordinary person.

https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	h3			 by Daniel Tomberlin
https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	img			Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a sacramental encounter. The embodied spirituality of Pentecostalism, expressed in the doctrine of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, suggests that Pentecostalism is essentially sacramental. Sacraments are spiritual graces and those who participate in faith encounter the “real presence” of Christ through the Holy Spirit. As we approach the altar to participate in sacramental worship, we do so “in the Spirit.” The Holy Spirit makes us aware of heavenly realities, and we experience heavenly mysteries.

He argues that the function of poetry is to evoke (and provoke) the passions and to form the affections. The study of the Psalms, therefore, can benefit from a hermeneutic that appreciates the affective component of the text and that takes full advantage...

Sinners are encouraged to come forward to the altar to ""pray through"" to salvation. Believers are encouraged to come to the altar to pray for sanctification, or to ""pray through"" to the baptism in the Holy Spirit. During the altar service, those who are sick, or otherwise in need, are encouraged to come to the altar. There the church elders will anoint with oil, lay their hands upon the sick, and pray for healing. "

https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	em			Toward a Pentecostal Theology of Religions Encountering Cornelius Today
https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	h3			 by Tony Richie
https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	img			A topic of ever increasing importance, theology of religions requires Spirit-gifted and Spirit-attuned reflection, reasoning, and discernment. Religiously motivated violence is precipitating an international security crisis. Even in relatively peaceful environs, globalization has contributed to the unprecedented co-existence of peoples of cultural diversity and religious plurality. In particular, global Pentecostalism blends diverse social, racial, economic, and national groups together with diverse religious and intellectual traditions. Such complexities point to a need for an intentional and articulate Pentecostal theology of religions as a consistent and coherent guide for living and ministering in a world of multiple religious faiths. The conversation of this book is framed by the transformative encounter of the Jewish Christian apostle, Peter, and the Gentile pagan convert, Cornelius (Acts 10). It confronts straightforwardly the reality of non-Christian religions and calls for a substantive Pentecostal response. It rejects the relativistic ideology of religious pluralism. More than that, drawing from classical Pentecostal heritage and engaging leading contemporary theologians, it presents a viable alternative to pluralistic philosophy. The result is a distinctively Pentecostal theology of religions marked by high Christology and robust pneumatology with a strong sense of ecclesial mission through evangelism and dialogue.

https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	em			Speaking by the Spirit: A Pentecostal Model for Interreligious Dialogue (Asbury Theological Seminary Series in World Christian Revita)
https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	span			This work develops a Classical Pentecostal theology of religions that utilizes their tradition of testimony as a pneumatological paradigm for interreligious encounter and dialogue. The author shows that Pentecostals have the opportunity of using their historic practice of personal testimony as a public form of Spirit-inspired speech for engaging in interfaith conversations. This study examines the contemporary setting of cultural diversity and religious plurality that is fast becoming typically descriptive of a world increasingly characterized by globalization with a focus on issues involving Pentecostals, especially with its strong heritage of evangelism and missions, generally conservative ethical and theological history, and undeniable multicultural variety. Its context is the United States, but its conversation is global.
https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	em			Pentecostal Explorations for Holiness Today: Words from Wesley
https://www.ptseminary.edu/faculty-books.php	span			This short but powerful volume addresses the important role of sanctification in the lives of believers. It aims to motivate Christians and aid them in advancing on their journey toward holy love and Christlikeness. Randy Howard and Tony Richie speak as third-generation ministers in the Holiness-Pentecostal tradition where sanctification as a second blessing has been securely anchored for several generations. Unfortunately, the experience of sanctification, teaching on sanctification, and the pursuit of holiness have all but disappeared from the contemporary church. Advancing a conversation on how holiness and sanctification is a critical need of the Church, Howard and Richie suggest ways that holiness might be freshly packaged for a new day, new presentation, new culture, and new generation. This exploration is aided by taking a new look at John Wesley’s contagious vision and passion for holiness and sanctification. Believers, churches, pastors, and leaders will find in these pages constructive ideas, practical recommendations, and concrete steps toward the pursuit of holiness and sanctification.
