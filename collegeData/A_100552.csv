https://www.erskine.edu/admissions-aid/visit	strong			A Great Destination
https://www.erskine.edu/admissions-aid/visit	span			Erskine College located in the historic town of Due West, in Abbeville County, South Carolina. With a town population of 1,200 and a beautiful 90-acre campus, Due West is a quiet college town, perfect for study.
https://www.erskine.edu/admissions-aid/visit	span			From sports to the arts, there’s a lot to do on the Erskine campus, but within only a 30-minute drive you’ll find plenty of shopping, historical sites, and a number of recreational areas that offer boating, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking.
https://www.erskine.edu/admissions-aid/visit	span			Within an hour’s drive, the Greenville-Spartanburg area offers a flourishing arts and culture scene with ethnic restaurants, concert and theatre venues, an annual arts festival, and an international airport for visits home or to study abroad.
https://www.erskine.edu/admissions-aid/visit	span			And within three hours of campus are major metropolitan areas like Atlanta, Georgia, and Charlotte, North Carolina, as well as Asheville, home to a thriving arts community.   
https://www.erskine.edu/admissions-aid/visit	strong			A Close-Knit Community   
https://www.erskine.edu/admissions-aid/visit	span			At Erskine, our difference starts with our size. You can do things here you just can’t do at larger schools. Like walk two minutes to class, know the names of all your classmates, or receive individual attention from your professors. 
https://www.erskine.edu/admissions-aid/visit	span			As a Christian liberal arts college, we educate students for careers, but more importantly, we prepare you for your life’s calling. We’re committed to equipping students as whole persons – intellectually, physically, and spiritually — to make a positive impact on their families and communities, their nation, and the world.
https://www.erskine.edu/admissions-aid/visit	span			Small classes support student interaction and intellectual development. Erskine encourages person-to-person communication to maximize student learning. In fact, a primary focus at Erskine is on personal interaction that leads to lasting friendships and discovery within a community of engaged learners. Many professors even invite students into their homes, forming significant and lifelong friendships.

http://www.erskine.edu	span			Why Erskine?
http://www.erskine.edu	span			A History of Learning
http://www.erskine.edu	p			Since it was established by the Associate Reformed Presbyterian (ARP) Church in 1839, Erskine College has been committed to the principle that facts and values–learning and faith–are inseparable. With this foundation, Erskine is committed to developing the whole person as a lifelong learner, encouraging students to think critically about their academic studies, with minds and hearts open to the truth.
http://www.erskine.edu	span			Student Focus
http://www.erskine.edu	p			Each of Erskine’s  degree programs can be customized by working with faculty to create a course of study that suits your personal and career interests. All of your classes will be taught by your professors, not by teaching assistants. And you’ll get plenty of face time with those professors since our student-faculty ratio is 11:1 and nearly all class sections have fewer than 25 students.
http://www.erskine.edu	span			Destination: Due West
http://www.erskine.edu	p			Erskine College is nestled into historic Due West, in Abbeville County, South Carolina. With a population of 1,200 and a 90-acre campus with a student body of just under 600, Due West is a quiet college town, perfect for study. From sports to the arts, there’s a lot to do on the Erskine campus, but within only a 30-minute drive you’ll find plenty of shopping, historical sites, and a number of recreational areas that offer boating, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking.
