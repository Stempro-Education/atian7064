http://www.sterlingcollege.edu	div	h1		Sterling College knows that the most rewarding learning is hands-on learning. Whether offered on campus in a laboratory or seminar room, on the side of a mountain, or in a barn or pasture, classes at Sterling are small and foster experiential learning and deep inquiry through close relationships between faculty and students.  Students will gain insight into theory, integrate research into study, and learn how to use tools such as a chainsaw, a compass, and a tractor as part of daily life.   Sterling College removes the barriers between living one’s life and learning. We are a good fit for the student who wants to commit to ecological thinking and action and looks forward to the rigor and challenge of working with hands, mind, and heart.

http://www.sterlingcollege.edu/admissions-aid/apply	p			Sterling College uses education as a force to address critical ecological problems caused by unlimited growth and consumption that is destroying the planet as we have known it. Our mission is to advance ecological thinking and action through affordable experiential learning that prepares people to be knowledgeable, skilled, and responsible leaders in the communities in which they live.
http://www.sterlingcollege.edu/admissions-aid/apply	p			Sterling acknowledges that the land on which we gather is the traditional and unceded territory of the Abenaki people on our Vermont campus, and the Shawnee, Osage, and the Eastern band of the Cherokee on our Kentucky campus.
