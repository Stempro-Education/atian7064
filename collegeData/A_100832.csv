http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	p			  Students who have successfully completed Advanced Placement courses and the appropriate examinations provided by the College Entrance Examination Board may apply for college credit for this work.
http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	p			  Scores of 4 or 5 on the examinations may entitle students to at least one course credit; scores of 1, 2 or, in most cases, 3, are not granted credit. 
http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	p			  Each department determines the specific amount of credit to be awarded. Credit will not be granted for both Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate program examinations in the same department.

http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	p			  Students who have successfully completed International Baccalaureate courses and taken the higher-level examinations provided by the IB Program may apply for college credit for this work.
http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	p			  Grades of 4, 5, 6, or 7 on the examinations entitle students to at least one course credit; grades of 1, 2, and 3 are not granted credit. Each department determines the specific amount of credit to be awarded. Credit will not be granted for both Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate program examinations in the same department.

http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	h4			Scores from this year
http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	p		a	  If the College’s registrar has not yet received your AP or IB test and you wish to take a course in that discipline, you should register for the lower-level course in the department in question. For example, if you took the AP Test in Psychology, you should register for Psychology 110. Once we receive your score and determine that it satisfies our criteria, we will notify you so that you may change your schedule and enroll in the higher-level course – after consulting with your advisor, of course. Be sure to review the 
http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	a			general information, prerequisites, and placement tests
http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	p			 page, which also provides links to the course schedule and charts for AP and IB credit.
http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	h4			Credit by Examination
http://www.lakeforest.edu/admissions/apply/ap.php	p			  Students may apply to pass a regular course by special examination without prior enrollment. Consent of the instructor and approval of the Dean of the Faculty are required. Where appropriate, the instructor may set requirements in addition to the examination itself. For credit to be awarded, a grade of D– or better must be earned on the examination, but the student’s transcript will show only a P (Pass). Special examinations are not allowed for courses that are usually part of pre-college curricula (for example, elementary languages or elementary mathematics) and are not normally allowed in courses previously audited or in which a student was enrolled. Students will be charged for course credits they earn by examination.
