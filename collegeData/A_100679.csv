http://www.hanover.edu/admission	a			Business Scholars Program

http://www.hanover.edu/admission	p	h4		Families sometimes worry when they hear the term private college. They might automatically equate that to higher tuition costs or perceive that only certain kinds of students are accepted. Sometimes these myths cause them to immediately cross private schools off their list.
http://www.hanover.edu/admission	p	p		In actuality, private colleges offer students smaller class sizes, greater personalization where each student is individually nurtured and opportunities for students to customize their education to fit their specific needs.
http://www.hanover.edu/admission	p	p		At Hanover specifically, 98 percent of students get a job or pursue graduate school shortly after graduation.
