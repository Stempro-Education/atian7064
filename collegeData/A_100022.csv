https://www.albright.edu/admission-aid/visit	h3			We hear it over and over again: When students talk about why they chose Albright, they say that during their campus visit, the campus felt like home.
https://www.albright.edu/admission-aid/visit	p	h3		Maybe it’s our beautiful 118 acres, which allow room for exploration but never feel overwhelming. Maybe it’s our facilities, which provide the perfect setting to live and learn in. Maybe it’s the people of Albright, who are diverse in their backgrounds and interests, and always welcoming. It’s hard to put a finger on exactly what it is. That’s why we hope you’ll come experience Albright for yourself.
