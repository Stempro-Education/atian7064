https://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	- Academic dishonesty and plagiarism are very serious offenses.  Each student is expected to do 
https://online.ewc.edu	strong			his/her own
https://online.ewc.edu	p		u	 thinking on all quizzes, tests, class work, book reports, research papers, and homework assignments.  If any student is found to be copying from another student, books, or internet sites, or cheating during a quiz or test, he/she will be referred to the Student Counseling Center, have a conference with the teacher, and 
https://online.ewc.edu	u			a grade of F for this course will be awarded.  
https://online.ewc.edu	p			 The student may also be dropped from the course.
https://online.ewc.edu	strong			Attendance
https://online.ewc.edu	u			No more than three (3) unexcused absences 
https://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		are permitted in a semester in order to pass this course.  All other absences require a doctor’s note, hospital note, court form, juror duty request, obituary program, or an official note to be 
https://online.ewc.edu	u			considered 
https://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		as an excused absence.   
https://online.ewc.edu	p			Attendance plays a major role in the learning process.  Students should attend class prepared to work in order to achieve academic success.
https://online.ewc.edu	strong			Late Work-
https://online.ewc.edu	em	em		o late work accepted.
https://online.ewc.edu	strong			Absences Caused by Short-term Suspensions- 
https://online.ewc.edu	em	strong		Provide the policy regarding absences that result from short-term suspensions. This may be folded in to the attendance and late work policies above, or it can be a separate statement such as the following:
https://online.ewc.edu	p			Absences that result from short-term suspensions due to violations of the principles outlined in the Student Life Agreement will be treated as unexcused absences, and significant academic penalties may apply as a result of such unexcused absences.  
https://online.ewc.edu	u			Attendance Policy
https://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		Effective Fall 2016-Campus Wide)
https://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	Students must be present for 80
https://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	 of the scheduled course time in order to receive credit for a course.  Please note that students who miss more than six
https://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	) class periods will not receive credit for the course and will be given an 
https://online.ewc.edu	p			 grade (Failure for Non-Attendance).  We will no longer provide excused absences to ensure compliance to this policy.  Students with extenuating circumstances may appeal to the Office of Academic Affairs and may be granted an administrative withdrawal from their respective course (s) and/or receive a W, WP, or WF depending on their grade and time period in the semester at which they fail to meet the 66% attendance rule.  Students representing the college with sufficient documentation from the Athletic Department, Choir, Band, and other auxiliary organizations will receive an excuse for “Official College Business.”  
https://online.ewc.edu	strong			Note:
https://online.ewc.edu	p			  Students conducting “Official College Business” are required to attend all classes unless the Office of Academic Affairs and the Instructor of Record have been given prior notice by the activity director that the student will be absent.  Under no circumstances will students be excused from class for practice. 
https://online.ewc.edu	u			Late Arrival Policy
https://online.ewc.edu	p			It is important that students arrive to class on time.  
https://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	Because we cannot always plan for unforeseen circumstances, 
https://online.ewc.edu	em			students will be allowed a grace period of 5 minutes only
https://online.ewc.edu	strong			Beyond 5 minutes up to 15 minutes late, students will be marked tardy.
https://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	  The accumulation of 
https://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		tardies
https://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		will be the equivalent of 1 absence
https://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	Students who are 
https://online.ewc.edu	strong			late beyond 15 minutes, for any reason, will be marked absent for the day.
https://online.ewc.edu	strong			Remember: 
https://online.ewc.edu	u			Students must attend at least 80% of class sessions to receive any credit for the course. 
https://online.ewc.edu	span			Outside-of-Class Expectations- 
https://online.ewc.edu	span	strong		Learning takes time; the more effectively you spend time, the greater the chance of success in learning. To maximize learning in this class, you should budget at least 2
https://online.ewc.edu	span	span		 hours outside of class for every 1 hour of scheduled class time. 
https://online.ewc.edu	span			Class Expectations-
https://online.ewc.edu	span	strong		 The College seeks to provide an environment where discussions and expressions of all views relevant to the subject are recognized and necessary to the educational process.  Students do not have the right to interfere with the instructor’s right to teach or the other students’ right to learn.  A student demonstrating inappropriate behavior during class time will be asked to leave the class.  The student’s behavior will be discussed with the instructor following the class or prior to the next class session.  
https://online.ewc.edu	u			Cell phones 
https://online.ewc.edu	u			are not needed in class.  Leave them home, or they must be turned off during class time.  They are distracting for other students who are here to learn as well as a distraction to the instructor.
https://online.ewc.edu	span			Disability Accommodations- Disability Accommodations- If a student has a disability that qualifies under the Americans Disability Act (ADA) and requires accommodations; he/she should contact the Counseling Center for information on appropriate policies and procedures.  Disabilities covered by ADA may include learning, psychiatric, physical disabilities, or chronic health disorders.  Students can contact the Counseling Center staff if they are not certain whether a medical condition/disability qualifies.

https://online.ewc.edu	h2			METHODS OF INSTRUCTIONS
https://online.ewc.edu	p			A variety of  technological and informational resources (e.g. libraries, databases, computer  networks, video, overhead transparencies)         
https://online.ewc.edu	p			      Lectures

https://online.ewc.edu	b			Academic Policies
https://online.ewc.edu	b			Academic Dishonesty
https://online.ewc.edu	p		b	- Academic dishonesty and  plagiarism are very serious offenses.   Each student is expected to do 
https://online.ewc.edu	b			his/her  own
https://online.ewc.edu	p		u	 thinking on all quizzes, tests, class work, book reports, research  papers, and homework assignments.  If any  student is found to be copying from another student, books, or internet sites,  or cheating during a quiz or test, he/she will be referred to the Student  Counseling Center, have a conference with the teacher, and 
https://online.ewc.edu	u			a grade of F for  this course will be awarded.  
https://online.ewc.edu	p			 The student may also be dropped from the  course.
https://online.ewc.edu	b			Attendance
https://online.ewc.edu	b		u	are permitted in a  semester in order to pass this course.   All other absences require a doctor’s note, hospital note, court form,  juror duty request, obituary program, or an official note to be 
https://online.ewc.edu	b			as  an excused absence.   
https://online.ewc.edu	p			Attendance  plays a major role in the learning process.   Students should attend class prepared to work in order to achieve  academic success.
https://online.ewc.edu	i			Your regular  class room attendance is required for you to attain the best from this  course.  Since effective teaching is data  based and research driven, research indicates that learning is most affected by  attendance. Therefore, your attendance also affords you the opportunity to  learn effective teaching techniques that are discussed and modeled throughout  the course. Lack of attendance hinders your opportunity to earn the points  required for an A grade.
https://online.ewc.edu	b			Late Work-
https://online.ewc.edu	p			 Late Work: 1. Every assignment has a due date. Students are  expected to submit assignments on or before the assigned due date. 
https://online.ewc.edu	p			2. Papers handed in after the due date will  receive a 5-point deduction for each DAY/CLASS PERIOD (or part thereof)  following the due date. This late policy will apply to all assignments for  which no application for extension has been made. 
https://online.ewc.edu	b			Absences  Caused by Short-term Suspensions-
https://online.ewc.edu	p			Absences that result from short-term suspensions due to violations  of the principles outlined in the Student Life Agreement will be treated as  unexcused absences, and significant academic penalties may apply as a result of  such unexcused absences.  
https://online.ewc.edu	b			Other  Absences – This is not an on-line class, therefore, daily attendance is  required.  Although the College allows  for three excused absences, a severe penalty for 10 or more absences exist for  THIS CLASS. There are only 45 class days per semester,
https://online.ewc.edu	b			anyone with  10 unexcused absences cannot expect a grade above a C. If you miss 66% of class  do not expect to pass THIS CLASS.
https://online.ewc.edu	b			Outside-of-Class Expectations-
https://online.ewc.edu	p			Learning  takes time; the more effectively you spend time, the greater the chance of  success in learning. To maximize learning in this class, you should budget at  least 2 hours outside of class for every 1 hour of scheduled class time. If you  plan on multi-tasking during study (surfing the Internet, listening to music,  texting, Tweeting, etc.), please budget additional time.
https://online.ewc.edu	b			Class Expectations-
https://online.ewc.edu	p			 The College seeks to provide an  environment where discussions and expressions of all views relevant to the  subject are recognized and necessary to the educational process.  Students do not have the right to interfere  with the instructor’s right to teach or the other students’ right to  learn.  A student demonstrating  inappropriate behavior during class time will be asked to leave the class.  The student’s behavior will be discussed with  the instructor following the class or prior to the next class session.  
https://online.ewc.edu	u			Cell phones and beepers are not  needed in class.  Leave them home, or  they must be turned off during class time.   They are distracting for other students who are here to learn as well as  a distraction to the instructor.
https://online.ewc.edu	b			Disability Accommodations.  
https://online.ewc.edu	p			If a student  has a disability that qualifies under the Americans Disability Act (ADA) and  requires accommodations; he/she should contact the Counseling Center for  information on appropriate policies and procedures. Disabilities covered by ADA  may include learning, psychiatric, physical disabilities, or chronic health disorders.  Students can contact the Counseling Center staff if they are not certain  whether a medical condition/disability qualifies.

http://online.ewc.edu	span			Academic Policies
http://online.ewc.edu	strong			Academic Dishonesty
http://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	- Academic dishonesty and plagiarism are very serious offenses.  Each student is expected to do 
http://online.ewc.edu	strong			his/her own
http://online.ewc.edu	p		u	 thinking on all quizzes, tests, class work, book reports, research papers, and homework assignments.  If any student is found to be copying from another student, books, or internet sites, or cheating during a quiz or test, he/she will be referred to the Student Counseling Center, have a conference with the teacher, and 
http://online.ewc.edu	u			a grade of F for this course will be awarded.  
http://online.ewc.edu	p			 The student may also be dropped from the course.
http://online.ewc.edu	strong			Attendance
http://online.ewc.edu	u			No more than three (3) unexcused absences 
http://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		are permitted in a semester in order to pass this course.  All other absences require a doctor’s note, hospital note, court form, juror duty request, obituary program, or an official note to be 
http://online.ewc.edu	u			considered 
http://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		as an excused absence.   
http://online.ewc.edu	p			Attendance plays a major role in the learning process.  Students should attend class prepared to work in order to achieve academic success.
http://online.ewc.edu	strong			Late Work-
http://online.ewc.edu	em	em		o late work accepted.
http://online.ewc.edu	strong			Absences Caused by Short-term Suspensions- 
http://online.ewc.edu	em	strong		Provide the policy regarding absences that result from short-term suspensions. This may be folded in to the attendance and late work policies above, or it can be a separate statement such as the following:
http://online.ewc.edu	p			Absences that result from short-term suspensions due to violations of the principles outlined in the Student Life Agreement will be treated as unexcused absences, and significant academic penalties may apply as a result of such unexcused absences.  
http://online.ewc.edu	u			Attendance Policy
http://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		Effective Fall 2016-Campus Wide)
http://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	Students must be present for 80
http://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	 of the scheduled course time in order to receive credit for a course.  Please note that students who miss more than six
http://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	) class periods will not receive credit for the course and will be given an 
http://online.ewc.edu	p			 grade (Failure for Non-Attendance).  We will no longer provide excused absences to ensure compliance to this policy.  Students with extenuating circumstances may appeal to the Office of Academic Affairs and may be granted an administrative withdrawal from their respective course (s) and/or receive a W, WP, or WF depending on their grade and time period in the semester at which they fail to meet the 66% attendance rule.  Students representing the college with sufficient documentation from the Athletic Department, Choir, Band, and other auxiliary organizations will receive an excuse for “Official College Business.”  
http://online.ewc.edu	strong			Note:
http://online.ewc.edu	p			  Students conducting “Official College Business” are required to attend all classes unless the Office of Academic Affairs and the Instructor of Record have been given prior notice by the activity director that the student will be absent.  Under no circumstances will students be excused from class for practice. 
http://online.ewc.edu	u			Late Arrival Policy
http://online.ewc.edu	p			It is important that students arrive to class on time.  
http://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	Because we cannot always plan for unforeseen circumstances, 
http://online.ewc.edu	em			students will be allowed a grace period of 5 minutes only
http://online.ewc.edu	strong			Beyond 5 minutes up to 15 minutes late, students will be marked tardy.
http://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	  The accumulation of 
http://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		tardies
http://online.ewc.edu	strong	strong		will be the equivalent of 1 absence
http://online.ewc.edu	p		strong	Students who are 
http://online.ewc.edu	strong			late beyond 15 minutes, for any reason, will be marked absent for the day.
http://online.ewc.edu	strong			Remember: 
http://online.ewc.edu	u			Students must attend at least 80% of class sessions to receive any credit for the course. 
http://online.ewc.edu	span			Outside-of-Class Expectations- 
http://online.ewc.edu	span	strong		Learning takes time; the more effectively you spend time, the greater the chance of success in learning. To maximize learning in this class, you should budget at least 2
http://online.ewc.edu	span	span		 hours outside of class for every 1 hour of scheduled class time. 
http://online.ewc.edu	span			Class Expectations-
http://online.ewc.edu	span	strong		 The College seeks to provide an environment where discussions and expressions of all views relevant to the subject are recognized and necessary to the educational process.  Students do not have the right to interfere with the instructor’s right to teach or the other students’ right to learn.  A student demonstrating inappropriate behavior during class time will be asked to leave the class.  The student’s behavior will be discussed with the instructor following the class or prior to the next class session.  
http://online.ewc.edu	u			Cell phones 
http://online.ewc.edu	u			are not needed in class.  Leave them home, or they must be turned off during class time.  They are distracting for other students who are here to learn as well as a distraction to the instructor.
http://online.ewc.edu	span			Disability Accommodations- Disability Accommodations- If a student has a disability that qualifies under the Americans Disability Act (ADA) and requires accommodations; he/she should contact the Counseling Center for information on appropriate policies and procedures.  Disabilities covered by ADA may include learning, psychiatric, physical disabilities, or chronic health disorders.  Students can contact the Counseling Center staff if they are not certain whether a medical condition/disability qualifies.

http://online.ewc.edu	b			Department of Teacher Education and Urban Studies and contributes to  the following program-level outcomes:
http://online.ewc.edu	p			To  successfully complete the Edward Waters College Teacher Education Program and to  be endorsed for certification as a teacher in State of Florida, a student must  have passing scores on the Florida Teacher Certification Examinations (FTCE –  General Knowledge, Subject Area, and Professional) and understand the standards  of Florida Education Accomplished Competencies, the Subject Area Competencies,  and the Professional Area Competencies and demonstrate proficiency in the four  areas listed below.
http://online.ewc.edu	p			 REFLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING:  Upon completion of the EWC TEP, each teacher  candidate will acquire the ability to take risks and decide the best course of  action in a given situation.  In  addition, teacher candidate will engage in reflective teaching and  decision-making by continuously assessing themselves as educators and their  students as learners by adjusting teaching and assessment.
http://online.ewc.edu	p			INSTRUCTIONAL  LEADER:  Upon completion of the EWC TEP,  each teacher candidate will be an instructional, knowledgeable leader in  his/her respective content area(s).

http://online.ewc.edu	p			EFFECTIVE  COMMUNICATOR:  Upon completion of the EWC  TEP, each teacher candidate will demonstrate the tools to identify,  characterize, and effectively communicate with diverse ethnic, cultural, and  linguistic groups present in today’s classrooms. 
http://online.ewc.edu	h2			METHODS OF INSTRUCTIONS
http://online.ewc.edu	p			A variety of  technological and informational resources (e.g. libraries, databases, computer  networks, video, overhead transparencies)         
http://online.ewc.edu	p			      Lectures
http://online.ewc.edu	p			      Group  Presentations
http://online.ewc.edu	p			      Reading  in textbook(s)
http://online.ewc.edu	p			      Modeling
http://online.ewc.edu	p			      Class  Discussion
http://online.ewc.edu	p		b	      Written  Assignments
http://online.ewc.edu	b			Academic Policies
http://online.ewc.edu	b			Academic Dishonesty
http://online.ewc.edu	p		b	- Academic dishonesty and  plagiarism are very serious offenses.   Each student is expected to do 
http://online.ewc.edu	b			his/her  own
http://online.ewc.edu	p		u	 thinking on all quizzes, tests, class work, book reports, research  papers, and homework assignments.  If any  student is found to be copying from another student, books, or internet sites,  or cheating during a quiz or test, he/she will be referred to the Student  Counseling Center, have a conference with the teacher, and 
http://online.ewc.edu	u			a grade of F for  this course will be awarded.  
http://online.ewc.edu	p			 The student may also be dropped from the  course.
http://online.ewc.edu	b			Attendance
http://online.ewc.edu	b		u	are permitted in a  semester in order to pass this course.   All other absences require a doctor’s note, hospital note, court form,  juror duty request, obituary program, or an official note to be 
http://online.ewc.edu	b			as  an excused absence.   
http://online.ewc.edu	p			Attendance  plays a major role in the learning process.   Students should attend class prepared to work in order to achieve  academic success.
http://online.ewc.edu	i			Your regular  class room attendance is required for you to attain the best from this  course.  Since effective teaching is data  based and research driven, research indicates that learning is most affected by  attendance. Therefore, your attendance also affords you the opportunity to  learn effective teaching techniques that are discussed and modeled throughout  the course. Lack of attendance hinders your opportunity to earn the points  required for an A grade.
http://online.ewc.edu	b			Late Work-
http://online.ewc.edu	p			 Late Work: 1. Every assignment has a due date. Students are  expected to submit assignments on or before the assigned due date. 
http://online.ewc.edu	p			2. Papers handed in after the due date will  receive a 5-point deduction for each DAY/CLASS PERIOD (or part thereof)  following the due date. This late policy will apply to all assignments for  which no application for extension has been made. 
http://online.ewc.edu	b			Absences  Caused by Short-term Suspensions-
http://online.ewc.edu	p			Absences that result from short-term suspensions due to violations  of the principles outlined in the Student Life Agreement will be treated as  unexcused absences, and significant academic penalties may apply as a result of  such unexcused absences.  
http://online.ewc.edu	b			Other  Absences – This is not an on-line class, therefore, daily attendance is  required.  Although the College allows  for three excused absences, a severe penalty for 10 or more absences exist for  THIS CLASS. There are only 45 class days per semester,
http://online.ewc.edu	b			anyone with  10 unexcused absences cannot expect a grade above a C. If you miss 66% of class  do not expect to pass THIS CLASS.
http://online.ewc.edu	b			Outside-of-Class Expectations-
http://online.ewc.edu	p			Learning  takes time; the more effectively you spend time, the greater the chance of  success in learning. To maximize learning in this class, you should budget at  least 2 hours outside of class for every 1 hour of scheduled class time. If you  plan on multi-tasking during study (surfing the Internet, listening to music,  texting, Tweeting, etc.), please budget additional time.
http://online.ewc.edu	b			Class Expectations-
http://online.ewc.edu	p			 The College seeks to provide an  environment where discussions and expressions of all views relevant to the  subject are recognized and necessary to the educational process.  Students do not have the right to interfere  with the instructor’s right to teach or the other students’ right to  learn.  A student demonstrating  inappropriate behavior during class time will be asked to leave the class.  The student’s behavior will be discussed with  the instructor following the class or prior to the next class session.  
http://online.ewc.edu	u			Cell phones and beepers are not  needed in class.  Leave them home, or  they must be turned off during class time.   They are distracting for other students who are here to learn as well as  a distraction to the instructor.
http://online.ewc.edu	b			Disability Accommodations.  
http://online.ewc.edu	p			If a student  has a disability that qualifies under the Americans Disability Act (ADA) and  requires accommodations; he/she should contact the Counseling Center for  information on appropriate policies and procedures. Disabilities covered by ADA  may include learning, psychiatric, physical disabilities, or chronic health disorders.  Students can contact the Counseling Center staff if they are not certain  whether a medical condition/disability qualifies.
