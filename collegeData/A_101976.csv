That’s why there's no shortage of clubs, organizations and social events to be a part of here on campus. Taking advantage of all there is to do on campus allows you to live your college life to the fullest.

About 80% of UWA students receive some type of financial aid to support their studies. The Financial Aid Center will assist you and your family in tailoring a financial aid package to cover the cost of tuition, fees, books, room, board, personal expenses, and travel.

At UWA, you’ll find our greatest strength is the personal attention and support you'll receive from small classes, led by professors who are leaders in their respective fields. You’ll find plentiful opportunities to make a difference outside of class, too: academically, socially, and in service. Mostly, though, you’ll find that UWA is like family — where people invest their own lives to help you make the most of yours.
http://www.uwa.edu/admissions	p			At UWA, you’ll be surrounded by people who hold your best interests at heart. You’ll find all the support you need to be successful, even as you work and play harder than you ever have. And when you finish, you’ll find the skills and experiences you’ve gained while earning your degree will allow you to pursue important work — the kind of work that matters in the lives of others.
