https://memphisseminary.edu/admissions	strong			ADMISSIONS
https://memphisseminary.edu/admissions	span			Memphis Theological Seminary’s vision of theological education for ministry engages students throughout their studies in the practice of ministry. The MTS curriculum integrates theological study with practical experience in a variety of ministry settings. Five different courses spread throughout the curriculum have practicum’s. Additionally, students are required to take at least one “immersion” course in which the classroom becomes the city, farms and rural churches, the courts and jails, or a place of hospitality for homeless persons. All of the faculty at MTS are experienced practitioners of ministry, ranging from congregational settings in both urban and rural areas to non-profit organizations to chaplaincies. They know how to connect seminary education with the practice of ministry.
https://memphisseminary.edu/admissions	span			Finally, at MTS we know that preparation for ministry is not only about the head, but also about relationship with God in a community of faith. Formation for Ministry, regular opportunities for worship, time for prayer in the chapel, and colloquies with visiting scholars and activists, ensure that students have the space to develop spiritually as they prepare for ministry. We are dedicated to educating students so that they are well prepared to have a lively pastoral imagination, open to challenges, ready for difficult days, and committed to serving God through service in the church and the broader community.

https://memphisseminary.edu/applications	b			Guest Students
https://memphisseminary.edu/applications	span			  Have you ever wanted to sit in on a seminary class and gain some theological education but not worry about doing homework, taking exams, or writing papers? Guest students are welcome to “audit” any regularly offered class at Memphis Theological Seminary. If you have a desire to learn and to participate in theological education, but not as a credit earning student, you should consider this option. Guest students attend the scheduled classes, and learn alongside degree seeking students, but are not responsible for graded assignments. Some guest students may take a set schedule of classes and can earn a certificate, such as the Netters Certificate in Theological Education, or the Faith and Health Certificate. Guest students pay a $400 “auditors fee,” and are not eligible for financial aid. For more information about registering as a guest student, please contact the Office of Admissions.
