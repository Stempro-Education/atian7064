https://www.coloradomesa.edu/admissions/why-cmu.html	p			Colorado Mesa University believes that smaller classrooms are better than big ones. We believe that students should be known by their names, not by their student numbers.
https://www.coloradomesa.edu/admissions/why-cmu.html	p			We believe in education. In learning. Of improving one's lot in life. Of making the next generation better than the one before it. We believe that quality education should be possible for everyone.
