https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h1	script		Steps to become an Osprey 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	span			We're excited you've chosen to apply to the University of North Florida! If you are ready to apply for admission, you’re in the right place. Just follow the steps below to become an Osprey!
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h2			Step 1: Create an Osprey Account
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	span			Click the Create an Osprey Account button below to create an Osprey Account. When you are in the Osprey Account portal, look for the Create Account link. It only takes a few minutes to generate your Osprey Account. You can always make updates to your account and access your application through this link.
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	a			Create an Osprey Account
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h2			Step 2: Fill out your application
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p			There are two ways to fill out a UNF application:
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	li			After you create an Osprey Account, look for the Apply Now link on the top right corner of your screen. This link will take you to the institutional UNF online application. A great benefit of applying through your Osprey Account is that you can edit your application anytime.
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	li			UNF now accepts the Common Application. The Common Application must be completed online at commonapp.org. A nonrefundable $30 fee must be submitted with either application. *Note that Common Application is not available until August 1, but the UNF application is currently open.
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h2			Step 3: Send us your supplemental documentation
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p			This includes official transcripts, test scores and Self-reported Student Academic Record (SSAR).
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p		a	For more information about SSAR, please visit our 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	a			FAQ page
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p			*Note that SSAR is not available to submit until August 1, but the UNF application is currently open. 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h2			Step 4: Check the status of your admission decision via the myWings portal
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p		a	Check your email for important messages and instructions. Once you have submitted your application, you’ll be assigned an UNF ID number which will give you access to 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	a			myWings
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p		b	, UNF’s student portal. Please note, this is a separate account from your Osprey Account. You will want to check the portal often to see the status of your application. All future UNF communication will be sent via myWings. 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	b			You should receive access within three days.
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h3		br	If you want to change your major 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	b			You do not need to fill out a new application to change your major. 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	span	span		We recommend you wait until you are admitted then change your major through your academic advisor. If you are a transfer student changing between 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	a			limited/selective access
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	span	span		and non-limited/selective access majors, please 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	a	span		email your request
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	span			to the Office of Admissions. 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h3			If you have an in-progress application 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	span		a	If you started an application for admission but haven't submitted it yet, click to 
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	a			continue working on your application.
https://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	span			 If you have forgotten your login credentials, you can recover them by following the prompts on the login page. After submitting your application, you will be able to track the status of the application and your academic credentials in myWings.

http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p			There are two ways to fill out a UNF application:
http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	li			After you create an Osprey Account, look for the Apply Now link on the top right corner of your screen. This link will take you to the institutional UNF online application. A great benefit of applying through your Osprey Account is that you can edit your application anytime.
http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	li			UNF now accepts the Common Application. The Common Application must be completed online at commonapp.org. A nonrefundable $30 fee must be submitted with either application. *Note that Common Application is not available until August 1, but the UNF application is currently open.
http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h2			Step 3: Send us your supplemental documentation
http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p			This includes official transcripts, test scores and Self-reported Student Academic Record (SSAR).
http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p		a	For more information about SSAR, please visit our 
http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	a			FAQ page
http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	p			*Note that SSAR is not available to submit until August 1, but the UNF application is currently open. 
http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h2			Step 4: Check the status of your admission decision via the myWings portal

http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	b			You should receive access within three days.
http://www.unf.edu/admissions/applynow	h3		br	If you want to change your major
