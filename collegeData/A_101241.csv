http://blog.peirce.edu	a			Bringing Law School Within Your Reach
http://blog.peirce.edu	span		span	 Posted by 
http://blog.peirce.edu	span			Michael Agnello
http://blog.peirce.edu	abbr			Friday, January 10, 2020
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Are you interested in law school, but you’re not sure where to begin? 
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Like most busy adults, you are not alone. The decision to pursue a legal career is exciting, challenging and, for some, a little scary. It is also a field of study that people are truly passionate about. Every day, we see the impact the law has on individuals in areas such as social justice, victims’ compensation, constitutional rights and business ethics. Despite all of the lawyer jokes and stereotypes, a career in the legal profession really does enable you to make a positive impact on the lives of others.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		b	 As faculty chair of Legal Studies at Peirce College, I know how anxious students can get when it comes to pursuing a law degree. I also know the challenges that some individuals may face when chasing this dream.  That is why I am excited about Peirce’s new partnership with Rutgers Law School to offer a 
http://blog.peirce.edu	a			Bachelor-to-Juris Doctor Program
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 to eligible students. This program will enable students to complete their Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in six (6) years instead of the traditional seven (7).
http://blog.peirce.edu	b			How does it work?
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 After completing 94 credits towards their bachelor’s degree, eligible Peirce students may seek admission to Rutgers Law School. Courses successfully completed at Rutgers during the first year of law school will satisfy the remaining requirements of the bachelor’s degree at Peirce. This will save students both time and money.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		b	 To learn more about this new program, I hope you can join us for an 
http://blog.peirce.edu	a			Information Session 
http://blog.peirce.edu	b			on Saturday, January 18th from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. 
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		div	The Information Session takes place at Peirce College, located at 1420 Pine Street in Philadelphia, in Room 51. We look forward to seeing you.

http://blog.peirce.edu	a			From Criminology to Business – Meet Erica Walker
http://blog.peirce.edu	span			Adrian Zappala
http://blog.peirce.edu	abbr			Wednesday, January 08, 2020
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Growing up, Erica Walker thought her education and career would eventually lead to becoming a judge. After earning both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in criminology, Erica quickly realized this was not the path for her. Holding two degrees with little flexibility, Erica decided in order to really advance her career and future, she would need to return to school.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 In 2017, Erica met Steve Bird, Peirce’s Director of Strategic Partnerships & Corporate Enrollment at an event with her former employer. She learned of Peirce’s online options, flexibility, tuition discount for corporate partner employees, and the focus on adult learners. Erica was sold.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 “When I was deciding to return to school, I was a mom of a toddler looking for the option to take classes online in a flexible way that matched my needs,” said Erica. “Steve explained how Peirce had all of that and invited me to an open house on campus to learn more. That is where my decision was made.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		a	Erica soon met alumni and fellow classmates who spoke highly about the Peirce College family environment and Erica was hooked. She enrolled in Peirce’s 
http://blog.peirce.edu	a			Master of Science in Organizational Leadership & Management
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 (MSOLM) program in Fall 2017.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Choosing this program was easy for Erica because she was looking for a broader program that was business-centric with leadership ties. Erica said, “The MSOLM program at Peirce offered me entrepreneurial experience, public speaking classes, unique industry information, valuable leadership skills and more. I knew this degree could benefit me for what I saw in my future.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 During her time in the program, Erica gained more than she ever anticipated. “Peirce was the best experience of my life. From the classmates to my professors, I gained lifelong friends and knowledge I could not have received anywhere else. Every book I picked up taught me something new; every discussion I did educated me more; and every piece of coursework was more intriguing than the last.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 As a working mom, Erica did choose to take all her courses online and that was exactly what Erica needed. She said, “Having the option to be online granted me the balance I needed as a working mom and student. I was never overwhelmed. Peirce knows we work, we have family, etc. They have the courses set up in a way where you can get it done and done well.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Even as an online student, Erica felt the family environment she was sold on from the beginning. “I know it is cliché to say, but Peirce really is a family. I wasn’t sure I believed it at first, but I am here to say it is absolutely true. Everyone wants you to be successful; everyone wants to make sure you reach the finish line; and everyone is always available to support you.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 In June 2019, Erica proudly transitioned from a Peirce student to a Peirce alumna as she officially earned her Master of Science in Organizational Leadership & Management. She explained how this would not have been possible without her true inspiration – her daughter. “My daughter is young, but she watches me and understands. She is now in Kindergarten and comes home eager to do her homework to, ‘act like mommy.’ Motivating her to love school inspired me!”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Beyond motivating her daughter and achieving a second graduate degree, Erica landed a phenomenal position as the Director of Admissions and Outreach for Job Corps. Erica never imagined she would have had the opportunity to land this type of career. She said, “My new degree got me my new job. It opened doors for me that weren’t available to me prior to graduation.” 
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		div	 Congratulations to Erica on all of her accomplishments! Peirce is proud to have such inspirational alumna telling the Peirce story to the community.

http://blog.peirce.edu	a			Inspired By His Mother, Dedicated To His Studies: Meet Andrew Tong
http://blog.peirce.edu	span			Brad Hodge
http://blog.peirce.edu	abbr			Tuesday, December 31, 2019
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		a	 Andrew Tong always wanted to make his mother proud and earn his college degree. He initially started his journey at another Philadelphia school, but found himself struggling with the larger class sizes and the program he selected. After finding his passion and his support team, Andrew Tong is graduating with his 
http://blog.peirce.edu	a			Bachelor of Science in Business Administration
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 from Peirce College this month!
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	Originally starting as a computer major at a different school, Andrew discovered this was not where he imagined his career going. He began looking into business courses and discovered this was the path for him.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Andrew said, “I discovered business is more of an in-depth program than I ever imagined. It is not just simply focusing on advertising or numbers, but rather it is detailed-oriented, foundational for most careers, and involves a lot of interests of mine.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 After determining he was ready for a fresh start, he began to look into Peirce College.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 “My mom graduated from Peirce College in 2012 with her Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. She recommended for me to transfer here. I came in for a visit and I was sold!”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Andrew met with Karen Hun, his personal Enrollment Specialist, who took him on a tour of the school and showed him the small class sizes and the capability to have more personalized attention. “When I realized I could get one-on-one interaction with professors, I knew I would do well here,” explained Andrew.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 In addition to this individualized service, Andrew discovered all of his previous college credits from his first school would transfer in and allow him to earn his degree even faster. He said, “I learned that over 60 college credits would be incorporated immediately into my bachelor’s degree and this would allow me to finish earlier for less money.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Once Andrew started at Peirce, he found the small class sizes were even better than anticipated and the professors supported him every step of the way. “Every professor always wanted to help me. If I ever felt like I was struggling, they would do whatever they could to help me,” said Andrew. “They always took the time to make sure I understood the content and did my best.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Beyond the support of the professors, Andrew had another support system at Peirce. Andrew and his wife, Solina, both were Peirce students together chasing their dreams of earning degrees side-by-side. Andrew said, “Going to school together was great because we could always help each other and support one another, which was really important.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 To add even more to his degree during his time at Peirce, Andrew also took part in the work-study program where he worked part-time for the Admissions, Student Financial Services, and Marketing departments. He said, “The work-study program was extremely beneficial to me because I got to work with three different departments and learn how they operate. I learned different skill sets that I can take into the workforce.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 As Andrew is now transitioning from a student to an alumnus, he reflects on his original inspiration to start this journey. “My mom has always valued education. She was the oldest of six and she had to sacrifice her education when she was younger to care for her siblings. When she was finally able to go back to school, she earned both her associate and bachelor’s degrees. She inspired me to pursue and finish my degree!”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		div	 Congratulations to Andrew on earning his bachelor’s degree! Peirce College is honored to serve such hard working and dedicated individuals.

http://blog.peirce.edu	a			A Passion for Education and Criminal Justice: Meet Danyelle Banks
http://blog.peirce.edu	span			Tom Tschop
http://blog.peirce.edu	abbr			Thursday, December 19, 2019
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Current Peirce College student Danyelle Banks always had an interest in Criminal Justice, so she was thrilled when she had an opportunity to enter the industry and work as a Correctional Lieutenant for The City of Philadelphia’s prison system. But as it sometimes happens, life can get in the way and derail original plans – in Danyelle’s case, it was the birth of her daughter. 
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	Danyelle was eager to get back to work shortly after her daughter was born and she still had the passion to work in the Criminal Justice field. After careful consideration, she decided going back to school would be the best way to keep her dreams alive. That’s what inspired Danyelle to enroll at The Community College of Philadelphia (CCP), one of Peirce College’s partner institutions, in 2013. 
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 “CCP was great for me,” Danyelle said. “It gave me the tools I needed to get back in the Criminal Justice field, but I also knew I wanted to continue with my education and earn my bachelor’s degree.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 While at Community College of Philadelphia, Danyelle learned that Peirce College and CCP are Dual Admissions Partners, which means that a CCP graduate can receive guaranteed acceptance at Peirce College and a $1,500 scholarship as long as their final GPA is a 2.5 or higher. Additionally, Peirce offers its community college partners an articulation scholarship and waived application fee, so it made academic and financial sense.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		a	 That is when Danyelle enrolled in Peirce’s 
http://blog.peirce.edu	a			Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 program.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 During her first visit to Peirce College, Danyelle met with Admissions Specialist Liz Pecora and immediately felt that she found the right fit. What made her decision even easier was Peirce’s Center City Philadelphia location, and how close the College is to her place of work, which is just a few blocks away. 
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 “It’s great to be close to the College after work because if I have a busy night I can go home and complete my school work online, but then if I need individualized attention or if the course work is more challenging, I can walk right down to campus. The convenience and flexibility is a major benefit for me,” Danyelle said. 
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Danyelle continues to work full time in the Municipal Services Building in the Streets Administration Department, and also serves as a union delegate shop steward. Though she enjoys her job and appreciates the opportunity to work for the City, Danyelle cannot wait to one day return to the Criminal Justice industry. “I love to help, serve, and assist others,” Danyelle said. “My next career goal is to make a difference in my community and help uplift those in need.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Though Danyelle is incredibly busy with her full time job, full time classes, her Union responsibilities, and her family, she does her best to find additional time to have fun with her children. “I’m a free spirit and I firmly believe that things will work out for anyone that stays true to themselves and treats others as they want to be treated,” she said.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Peirce College salutes The Community College of Philadelphia for providing Danyelle with an excellent educational foundation, and wishes Danyelle the best in her scholastic and professional future. 
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		div	 If you or someone you know is looking to transfer to Peirce College, please contact me, Tom Tschop, Director, Strategic Partnerships & Institutional Enrollment, at 215.670.9203 or ttschop@peirce.edu.

http://blog.peirce.edu	a			From Cosmetology to Healthcare: Meet Linda Mathis
http://blog.peirce.edu	span			Dr. Devida Rembert
http://blog.peirce.edu	abbr			Tuesday, December 17, 2019
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Starting her career as a licensed cosmetologist, Linda Mathis found herself working long hours and constantly traveling for hair shows. She found satisfaction in the work by providing help and self-confidence to other women, but she knew there was more she could be doing.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	One day, Linda decided to it was time to find out what that “more” was by returning to school to discover how she could continue to grow both personally and professionally.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 That is when Linda found Peirce College.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		a	 Originally starting at Peirce in 2008, Linda enrolled in the 
http://blog.peirce.edu	a			Associate in Science in Business Administration
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		a	 program. After earning her first degree in 2010, she knew she wasn’t done yet. She kept her motivation going and earned her 
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 with a concentration in Management in 2017.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 During her time earning her new degrees, she had a career change and found herself immersed in the healthcare industry. Gaining knowledge and a passion for this line of work, Linda was ready for more education to pair with her work experience. That is when she heard Peirce had a new master’s program that aligned with her goals.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		a	 Linda enrolled in Peirce College’s 
http://blog.peirce.edu	a			Master of Science in Healthcare Administration
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 (MSHCA) program and was ready to tackle her next educational journey.
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	During her time in the program, she gained valuable skills, knowledge, and relationships she could not get anywhere else. “Besides becoming more educated about the structures of the healthcare industry, I learned there were no limits to my growth and career as I have become an innovative and dependable healthcare professional,” explained Linda. “Throughout the MSHCA Program, I acquired the knowledge and understanding on how to create my own organizational designs within my department that includes employee engagement, staffing strategies, and an adequate decision-making process. I have also gained relationships with other individuals who were on the same journey as myself.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 After working hard and dedicating herself to her studies, Linda Mathis finished her third Peirce degree and graduated this month! Linda reflected on her 11 years at Peirce by saying, “My overall experience at Peirce College has been amazing. From the very start of my journey here, I have always felt welcomed when I walked through the doors or logged on to my online classes. The entire staff has always been extremely helpful to myself and other students. I will always appreciate their time and patience.”
http://blog.peirce.edu	div		br	 Linda is a proud first generation bachelor’s and master’s degree recipient in her family and she hopes to inspire others to return to school to achieve their dreams. She said, “If you have even an inkling of a thought about wanting to further your education, to elevate your career, or to reach a personal goal of obtaining a degree or certification, do not hesitate about enrolling in classes. It will be the most invigorating feeling after you have finished your program and have obtained that degree or certification!”
