http://www.georgetowncollege.edu	a			Engaging In Life's Pursuits
http://www.georgetowncollege.edu	small		a	That we will prepare you to be successful in any future career is a given. That we do more to raise our students' future earnings than 95% of the colleges in the country is now 
http://www.georgetowncollege.edu	a			an established fact
http://www.georgetowncollege.edu	small			. Even more than all of this, Georgetown College is focused on you as a whole person: it is our mission to prepare you to engage in all of your life's pursuits with thoughtfulness and skill.

Our minds have been nurtured by faculty who care deeply about our success. We have learned to think critically, and how to view the world through the lenses of science, history, literature, art - I could go on. We have the unique opportunity to graduate together - our commencement ceremony not separated by degree or major – something that is reflective of the multidisciplinary nature of our degrees from a liberal arts school. We leave here today as artists of morality, philosophers of sustainability, biologists of culture, and chemists of community.

http://www.georgetowncollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			How do I request a transcript?
