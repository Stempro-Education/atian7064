https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			The diversity of the student body at Holy Cross College is reflected in our broad offering of academic programs and unique enrollment pathways. Although our students are on many different academic journeys, all receive a timeless liberal arts education rooted in the Holy Cross tradition of educating the mind and heart. Our mission is to bring you to the deepest level of understanding of yourself and the world around you. Which academic path will you travel to get there?

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Traditional Degree
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	Most students at Holy Cross College are enrolled in a traditional, four-year degree program with one or more majors supplemented by one or more minors culminating in the conferment of a bachelor’s degree. The flexibility of our curriculum allows for a student to explore many interests to gain a broad foundation to begin a successful career or continue to graduate studies. All students, regardless of major, complete the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	a			core curriculum
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			, which is rooted in the Catholic intellectual tradition and is designed with a distinct goal: to form each student into a scholar, citizen, leader, and disciple prepared to make a difference in our global community.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			We strive to provide both a rigorous and personal classroom experience. The average class size is only 14 students, and there will be no class with more than 35 students in it. Lectures halls with hundreds of students? You won’t find them at Holy Cross College.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	The core curriculum includes several courses that are experience-based. 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	a			The Common Good Practicum and Seminar
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	 will immerse you in the local community to study and help solve real issues facing our neighbors. 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	a			The Global Perspectives Seminar
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	 will widen your world view and take you to places like Peru, Uganda, and India. You’ll also complete a

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			, gaining invaluable experience.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Majors and Minors
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	Although applicants are asked to indicate an intended major on the application, students at Holy Cross College have until the end of the first year to declare a major—or two! After the first year, you will be assigned an academic advisor specific to your major who will help guide you through the curriculum as well as serve as a mentor. These are the

Your success is our priority.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		strong	Full-time students who have earned at least 30 credits and maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA can enroll in one course each semester at the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			University of Notre Dame
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			, our tri-campus partner, as space allows and if prerequisites have been met. This opportunity is provided with no additional tuition charge, and First Year students who enroll with pre-matriculation credit (AP exams, dual enrollment, etc.) may qualify to participate as early as the second semester.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		strong	The Northern Indiana Consortium for Education (N.I.C.E.) consists of  Bethel College, Goshen College, Indiana University at South Bend, Ivy Tech Community College, Purdue Polytech–South Bend, and

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			, our tri-campus partner. With approval and on a space-available basis, Holy Cross students may enroll in courses offered by other N.I.C.E. institutions that are not offered at Holy Cross College at no additional tuition charge.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			69% of First Year students who are not enrolled in one-year transfer matriculation agreements return their second year.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Study Abroad
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			Some of the most transformative experiences happen in places we’ve never imagined ourselves. This is why Holy Cross College offers study abroad programs. Our partnership with four of Europe’s leading Catholic universities offers you the chance to gain a clearer sense of self while absorbing the world through full cultural immersion. You may be studying in Europe, but Holy Cross College is with you every step of the way, promising new perspectives and independence while making lasting connections with friends and mentors. Your tuition, meals and accommodations during your journey remain as they would here at home, so you’ll be ready to focus on what matters most: the discovery of your place in the world. Holy Cross College has articulation agreements with the following institutions:
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	li			John Cabot University, Rome, Italy

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Accelerated Degree
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			Holy Cross College offers accelerated programs in select majors. Among other benefits, the accelerated program offers significant savings of both cost and time; three-year students are ready to enter a career or graduate studies earlier with significantly less tuition commitment. The three-year curriculum is rigorous and ideal for a student who enters Holy Cross prepared to declare an accelerated major and take upper-level courses. First Year applicants can indicate an interest in an accelerated degree on the application
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Three-year degrees are currently offered in business, English, liberal studies, psychology, and theology.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Driscoll Scholars Program
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	Holy Cross College and the University of Notre Dame have partnered to create a program that allows students the opportunity to earn an undergraduate degree in a STEM major from Notre Dame after completing a 2 3 or 2 2 curriculum. Students selected for this program will complete two years of study at Holy Cross College as Driscoll Scholars, and if minimum requirements are fulfilled, will transfer to Notre Dame to complete remaining coursework. This is a highly-selected, transfer-preparation program.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Gateway Program
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	Holy Cross College and the University of Notre Dame have partnered to create a program that allows students the opportunity to enroll at Holy Cross College with a direct path to an undergraduate degree from Notre Dame. Students selected for the Gateway Program complete one year of studies at Holy Cross College, and if minimum requirements are fulfilled, transfer to Notre Dame to complete remaining degree requirements. This is a highly-selected, transfer-preparation program.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Transfer Preparation
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			We are committed to assisting students build personalized curriculum plans to meet individual goals. Some students complete a one- or two-year honors curriculum with the intention of transferring to larger colleges or universities.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		strong	It’s no secret that the many of our transfer-preparation students are interested in applying to the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			. Before we were a four-year institution, Notre Dame was a natural “next destination” for Holy Cross two-year graduates. You could say preparing students to transfer to Notre Dame is in our DNA. (Have you seen Rudy?)
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	If transferring to Notre Dame is your goal, we will do our best in helping you prepare a strong application. Namely, we will enroll you in the most rigorous courses for which you are eligible because your Holy Cross curriculum and GPA are major evaluation factors in the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	a			transfer application process
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	. (You should pay special attention to the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	a			required courses
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 for your intended area of study during course registration at Holy Cross.) Additionally, we recommend becoming engaged community members at Holy Cross from day one. Competitive applicants for transfer admission have displayed leadership in our classrooms, in student clubs, in our residence halls, and on our athletic teams. One of the benefits of enrolling at Holy Cross is the opportunity to become involved at Notre Dame, too, and even enroll in a course at Notre Dame.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	Transfer admission to Notre Dame is a very competitive process. Each fall, Notre Dame enrolls approximately 75 transfer students from a pool of nearly 800 applications. Among those who successfully earn transfer admission to Notre Dame, an average of eight to ten come from Holy Cross each year. We’re proud of this admission rate as it reflects the historical and trusted relationship between our two institutions. The average GPA of a Holy Cross student admitted as a transfer student is approximately 3.80. The median SAT test score is 1330. Typically, transfer students are entering the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	a			College of Arts and Letters
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	 to pursue a liberal arts degree.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Dual Degree and Graduate Programs
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			Holy Cross College, in collaboration with its tri-campus partners, has identified graduate programs in which Holy Cross students may receive preferred admission upon meeting minimum academic requirements and other criteria as set forth in the institutional agreements.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	 and 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Master of Science in Data Science
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 Programs. Holy Cross College students will apply during the junior year and begin taking graduate-level courses during the senior year. These programs, open to both men and women, are 4 1 dual degree programs, which means Holy Cross College students would complete a bachelors and graduate degree in five years.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	a			Student Employment
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			Many students take advantage of part-time student employment opportunities to earn funds to cover personal expenses.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			When listed on a financial aid notification, student employment represents the opportunity, not a requirement, to seek employment. The amount listed on a financial aid notification represents possible earnings. Actual earnings will depend on pay rate and the number of hours worked during the academic year. Students are paid directly according to the monthly pay schedule. Payments are not posted to a semester bill on the student account.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		a	Employment is available through both the Federal Work-Study Program and campus employment. Students with Federal Work-Study eligibility may work either on campus or for a community service agency.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Frequently Asked Questions
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: What is a Signature Scholarship?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: Signature Scholarships are Holy Cross College’s way of recognizing students who have special gifts to share with our campus community. These students embody talents, passions, and characteristics that will advance the mission of Holy Cross in faith, service, academics, and athletic excellence. Signature Scholarships are different from the Dean’s, President’s, and Trustee Scholarships, which are our standard merit awards. Recipients of a Signature Scholarship will not receive a standard merit award.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: How does the nomination process work?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: All new First Year applicants are automatically considered for nomination as part of the application review process by the Committee on Admissions. Those applicants selected as nominees will be notified of their status in the admissions packet. The nomination process is highly selective.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: How many Signature Scholarships will be awarded?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: The number of scholarships awarded will vary according to the number of nominations and quality of interviews.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: How much is a Signature Scholarship worth?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: This will vary based on a student’s application for admission and interview, but scholarships typically range from $14,000-$20,000 per year, renewable for up to four years of full-time enrollment. Some students receive additional need-based aid based on the results of the FAFSA.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: Am I more likely to receive a Signature Scholarship if I participate in an Interview Day?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: We prefer all scholarship nominees to visit campus for an in-person interview, but we also understand that schedules and cost of transportation will prevent some nominees from visiting campus. Therefore, all nominees who participate in an interview, whether in-person or by phone, will be similarly considered for a scholarship.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: Do I attend Interview Day alone or can I bring guests?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: Parents and other guests are invited to join you for Interview Day. There will be a special session offered for parents and guests while you are participating in interviews. If you attend Interview Day alone, that’s fine, too.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: How do I prepare for the interview?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: Campus interviewers will have reviewed your application for admission, which includes your essays, activities, and leadership history. Be prepared to answer questions about your participation in school, community, and church extracurricular activities as well as the reasons why you think you would be a good fit for Holy Cross College. Interviews will vary in time, but will likely not exceed 30 minutes. On-campus interviews can be individual and/or with small groups of other scholarship nominees.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: With whom will I interview?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: Faculty members, staff, and college leadership will serve as campus interviewers. You will be notified of your interviewer/s on Interview Day.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: What do I wear for the interview?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: Remember that you are trying to impress the campus interviewers before, during, and after your interview. This includes how you dress while visiting campus. Business casual and business professional attire are acceptable.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: How are final Signature Scholarship decisions made?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: A committee made of campus interviewers, admissions counselors, and financial aid staff will determine scholarship award amounts.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: Is there a GPA requirement to maintain the scholarship while I am enrolled at Holy Cross College?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: Yes. Anchor Award winners are expected to maintain a minimum 2.5 cumulative GPA, André Award winners are expected to maintain a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA, and Moreau Award winners are expected to maintain a minimum 3.3 cumulative GPA. If your GPA drops below the minimum, your award is subject to being reduced or removed until your GPA meets minimum requirements once more.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p		br	Q: For what other reasons could my scholarship award be adjusted?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			 A: The Office of Financial Aid reserves the right to adjust any Holy Cross College scholarship according to its policies. For example, the award could be adjusted if information is received (new outside scholarships, updated FAFSA, etc.) that requires an updated financial aid award letter.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			The Signature Scholarships
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Bl. Basil Moreau Award
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			Basil Moreau, a young priest and professor of Philosophy and Theology in post-revolutionary France, founded the Congregation of Holy Cross when he merged a group of “auxiliary priests” with the Brothers of St. Joseph in 1837. He sent his priests and brothers across France, and indeed the world, to revitalize the Church, educate young people, and make God known, loved, and served. At the direction of Father Moreau, Father Edward Sorin and six Holy Cross Brothers traveled from France to northern Indiana to found the University of Notre Dame in 1842. Today, the Congregation of Holy Cross oversees several colleges across the United States, including Holy Cross College. True to Moreau’s vision, Holy Cross schools around the world adopt a model of Christian education that is holistic, educating the heart and mind. Bl. Basil Moreau was beatified by Pope Benedict in 2007 in Le Mans, France.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			To honor Bl. Basil Moreau, this award recognizes students whose academic achievements and zeal for seeking the truth will strengthen the classroom experience for all Holy Cross College students.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			St. André Bessette Award
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			As a Holy Cross Brother, André Bessette lived an exemplary life of faith, hope, and charity. A simple man with little formal education, Br. André was assigned the position of doorkeeper at Notre Dame College in Montreal. Visitors began flocking to Br. André after his ministry to the afflicted and suffering resulted in miraculous healing at the intercession of St. Joseph. Because of his great love for Christ and St. Joseph, he oversaw the construction of the Oratory of St. Joseph, which continues to be a place for prayer, healing, and conversion of heart, not just for the people of Montreal, but also for pilgrims who visit it from all over the world. St. André Bessette, a humble servant of the Church, became the Congregation of Holy Cross’s first saint when he was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			In the spirit of St. André, this award recognizes students whose dedication to faith and service will uniquely strengthen the identity of Holy Cross College as a Catholic institution. St. André Scholars are expected to be active members of the campus community, serving as models of faith and charity, while they themselves are formed as Christians called to holiness.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			The Anchor Award for Athletics
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			Basil Moreau and André Bessette, two of the great Saints of Holy Cross, inspire us all to live heroic lives of character and mission. At Holy Cross, the Saints of our athletic teams live this out both in the classroom and on the courts, fields, and courses on which they play. For this reason, each of our varsity athletic teams selects one nominee for the Anchor Award for Athletics.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			The Anchor is part of the symbol of the Congregation of Holy Cross and thus has deep roots in our history and mission. It reminds us to be strong in our faith, to act with courage even in the midst of challenge, and to be unwavering in our sacrifice for our common mission. These are the values that the best athletes exhibit on behalf of their team. Thus the Anchor Award recipient will be a steady, consistent, and reliable source of leadership in helping the team—and indeed all their fellow Holy Cross Saints—to see what heroic virtue looks like.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			Regarding Financial Aid, Holy Cross is pleased to assist our veterans and their families by offering our support regarding the use of their Veteran Affairs (VA) benefits.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	strong			Post-9/11 GI Bill
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			Veterans who have served at least 90 days of active duty service after September 10, 2001 and received an honorable discharge will qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. To qualify for the full benefit a Veteran must have served at least 3 years of active duty after September 10, 2001. Those who qualify for the Active Duty GI Bill, the Reserve GI Bill or REAP* will have the option to choose which benefit best suits their need.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/admissions	p			The Yellow Ribbon Program was established by the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. This program allows institutions of higher learning (such as colleges, universities, and other degree-granting schools) in the United States to voluntarily enter into an agreement with VA to fund tuition and fee expenses that exceed the tuition and fee amounts payable under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The institution can contribute a specified dollar amount of those expenses, and VA will match the contribution, not to exceed 50% of the difference.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			Holy Cross College offers accelerated programs in select majors. Among other benefits, the accelerated program offers significant savings of both cost and time; three-year students are ready to enter a career or graduate studies earlier with significantly less tuition commitment. The three-year curriculum is rigorous and ideal for a student who enters Holy Cross prepared to declare an accelerated major and take upper-level courses. First Year applicants can indicate an interest in an accelerated degree on the application

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		a	Holy Cross College and the University of Notre Dame have partnered to create a program that allows students the opportunity to enroll at Holy Cross College with a direct path to an undergraduate degree from Notre Dame. Students selected for the Gateway Program complete one year of studies at Holy Cross College, and if minimum requirements are fulfilled, transfer to Notre Dame to complete remaining degree requirements. This is a highly-selected, transfer-preparation program.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	strong			Transfer Preparation
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			We are committed to assisting students build personalized curriculum plans to meet individual goals. Some students complete a one- or two-year honors curriculum with the intention of transferring to larger colleges or universities.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		strong	It’s no secret that the many of our transfer-preparation students are interested in applying to the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			. Before we were a four-year institution, Notre Dame was a natural “next destination” for Holy Cross two-year graduates. You could say preparing students to transfer to Notre Dame is in our DNA. (Have you seen Rudy?)
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		a	If transferring to Notre Dame is your goal, we will do our best in helping you prepare a strong application. Namely, we will enroll you in the most rigorous courses for which you are eligible because your Holy Cross curriculum and GPA are major evaluation factors in the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	a			transfer application process
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		a	. (You should pay special attention to the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	a			required courses
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 for your intended area of study during course registration at Holy Cross.) Additionally, we recommend becoming engaged community members at Holy Cross from day one. Competitive applicants for transfer admission have displayed leadership in our classrooms, in student clubs, in our residence halls, and on our athletic teams. One of the benefits of enrolling at Holy Cross is the opportunity to become involved at Notre Dame, too, and even enroll in a course at Notre Dame.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		a	Transfer admission to Notre Dame is a very competitive process. Each fall, Notre Dame enrolls approximately 75 transfer students from a pool of nearly 800 applications. Among those who successfully earn transfer admission to Notre Dame, an average of eight to ten come from Holy Cross each year. We’re proud of this admission rate as it reflects the historical and trusted relationship between our two institutions. The average GPA of a Holy Cross student admitted as a transfer student is approximately 3.80. The median SAT test score is 1330. Typically, transfer students are entering the 
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	a			College of Arts and Letters

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 Programs. Holy Cross College students will apply during the junior year and begin taking graduate-level courses during the senior year. These programs, open to both men and women, are 4 1 dual degree programs, which means Holy Cross College students would complete a bachelors and graduate degree in five years.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	strong			Frequently Asked Questions
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: What is a Signature Scholarship?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: Signature Scholarships are Holy Cross College’s way of recognizing students who have special gifts to share with our campus community. These students embody talents, passions, and characteristics that will advance the mission of Holy Cross in faith, service, academics, and athletic excellence. Signature Scholarships are different from the Dean’s, President’s, and Trustee Scholarships, which are our standard merit awards. Recipients of a Signature Scholarship will not receive a standard merit award.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: How does the nomination process work?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: All new First Year applicants are automatically considered for nomination as part of the application review process by the Committee on Admissions. Those applicants selected as nominees will be notified of their status in the admissions packet. The nomination process is highly selective.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: How many Signature Scholarships will be awarded?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: The number of scholarships awarded will vary according to the number of nominations and quality of interviews.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: How much is a Signature Scholarship worth?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: This will vary based on a student’s application for admission and interview, but scholarships typically range from $14,000-$20,000 per year, renewable for up to four years of full-time enrollment. Some students receive additional need-based aid based on the results of the FAFSA.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: Am I more likely to receive a Signature Scholarship if I participate in an Interview Day?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: We prefer all scholarship nominees to visit campus for an in-person interview, but we also understand that schedules and cost of transportation will prevent some nominees from visiting campus. Therefore, all nominees who participate in an interview, whether in-person or by phone, will be similarly considered for a scholarship.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: Do I attend Interview Day alone or can I bring guests?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: Parents and other guests are invited to join you for Interview Day. There will be a special session offered for parents and guests while you are participating in interviews. If you attend Interview Day alone, that’s fine, too.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: How do I prepare for the interview?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: Campus interviewers will have reviewed your application for admission, which includes your essays, activities, and leadership history. Be prepared to answer questions about your participation in school, community, and church extracurricular activities as well as the reasons why you think you would be a good fit for Holy Cross College. Interviews will vary in time, but will likely not exceed 30 minutes. On-campus interviews can be individual and/or with small groups of other scholarship nominees.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: With whom will I interview?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: Faculty members, staff, and college leadership will serve as campus interviewers. You will be notified of your interviewer/s on Interview Day.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: What do I wear for the interview?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: Remember that you are trying to impress the campus interviewers before, during, and after your interview. This includes how you dress while visiting campus. Business casual and business professional attire are acceptable.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: How are final Signature Scholarship decisions made?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: A committee made of campus interviewers, admissions counselors, and financial aid staff will determine scholarship award amounts.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: Is there a GPA requirement to maintain the scholarship while I am enrolled at Holy Cross College?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: Yes. Anchor Award winners are expected to maintain a minimum 2.5 cumulative GPA, André Award winners are expected to maintain a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA, and Moreau Award winners are expected to maintain a minimum 3.3 cumulative GPA. If your GPA drops below the minimum, your award is subject to being reduced or removed until your GPA meets minimum requirements once more.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p		br	Q: For what other reasons could my scholarship award be adjusted?
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			 A: The Office of Financial Aid reserves the right to adjust any Holy Cross College scholarship according to its policies. For example, the award could be adjusted if information is received (new outside scholarships, updated FAFSA, etc.) that requires an updated financial aid award letter.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	strong			The Signature Scholarships
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	strong			Bl. Basil Moreau Award
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			Basil Moreau, a young priest and professor of Philosophy and Theology in post-revolutionary France, founded the Congregation of Holy Cross when he merged a group of “auxiliary priests” with the Brothers of St. Joseph in 1837. He sent his priests and brothers across France, and indeed the world, to revitalize the Church, educate young people, and make God known, loved, and served. At the direction of Father Moreau, Father Edward Sorin and six Holy Cross Brothers traveled from France to northern Indiana to found the University of Notre Dame in 1842. Today, the Congregation of Holy Cross oversees several colleges across the United States, including Holy Cross College. True to Moreau’s vision, Holy Cross schools around the world adopt a model of Christian education that is holistic, educating the heart and mind. Bl. Basil Moreau was beatified by Pope Benedict in 2007 in Le Mans, France.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			To honor Bl. Basil Moreau, this award recognizes students whose academic achievements and zeal for seeking the truth will strengthen the classroom experience for all Holy Cross College students.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	strong			St. André Bessette Award
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			As a Holy Cross Brother, André Bessette lived an exemplary life of faith, hope, and charity. A simple man with little formal education, Br. André was assigned the position of doorkeeper at Notre Dame College in Montreal. Visitors began flocking to Br. André after his ministry to the afflicted and suffering resulted in miraculous healing at the intercession of St. Joseph. Because of his great love for Christ and St. Joseph, he oversaw the construction of the Oratory of St. Joseph, which continues to be a place for prayer, healing, and conversion of heart, not just for the people of Montreal, but also for pilgrims who visit it from all over the world. St. André Bessette, a humble servant of the Church, became the Congregation of Holy Cross’s first saint when he was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			In the spirit of St. André, this award recognizes students whose dedication to faith and service will uniquely strengthen the identity of Holy Cross College as a Catholic institution. St. André Scholars are expected to be active members of the campus community, serving as models of faith and charity, while they themselves are formed as Christians called to holiness.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	strong			The Anchor Award for Athletics
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			Basil Moreau and André Bessette, two of the great Saints of Holy Cross, inspire us all to live heroic lives of character and mission. At Holy Cross, the Saints of our athletic teams live this out both in the classroom and on the courts, fields, and courses on which they play. For this reason, each of our varsity athletic teams selects one nominee for the Anchor Award for Athletics.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			The Anchor is part of the symbol of the Congregation of Holy Cross and thus has deep roots in our history and mission. It reminds us to be strong in our faith, to act with courage even in the midst of challenge, and to be unwavering in our sacrifice for our common mission. These are the values that the best athletes exhibit on behalf of their team. Thus the Anchor Award recipient will be a steady, consistent, and reliable source of leadership in helping the team—and indeed all their fellow Holy Cross Saints—to see what heroic virtue looks like.

https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			Regarding Financial Aid, Holy Cross is pleased to assist our veterans and their families by offering our support regarding the use of their Veteran Affairs (VA) benefits.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	strong			Post-9/11 GI Bill
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			Veterans who have served at least 90 days of active duty service after September 10, 2001 and received an honorable discharge will qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. To qualify for the full benefit a Veteran must have served at least 3 years of active duty after September 10, 2001. Those who qualify for the Active Duty GI Bill, the Reserve GI Bill or REAP* will have the option to choose which benefit best suits their need.
https://www.hcc-nd.edu/section/admissions	p			The Yellow Ribbon Program was established by the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. This program allows institutions of higher learning (such as colleges, universities, and other degree-granting schools) in the United States to voluntarily enter into an agreement with VA to fund tuition and fee expenses that exceed the tuition and fee amounts payable under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The institution can contribute a specified dollar amount of those expenses, and VA will match the contribution, not to exceed 50% of the difference.
