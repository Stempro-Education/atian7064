http://www.wabash.edu	strong			COLLEGE FOR MEN
http://www.wabash.edu	p		strong	Wabash College asks you the most important question you will ever be asked: 
http://www.wabash.edu	strong			What kind of man do you want to be?
http://www.wabash.edu	p			 We then make an institutional commitment to help every Wabash student develop his own answer to this life-changing question by blending an intimate liberal arts education with our culture that emphasizes personal responsibility, resilience, and reflection.  
http://www.wabash.edu	a			A rigorous liberal arts education
http://www.wabash.edu	div			            Wabash offers qualified young men a superior education, fostering, in particular,                                           independent intellectual inquiry, critical thought, and clear written and oral expression           
http://www.wabash.edu	a			Individual responsibility and trust
http://www.wabash.edu	div			            Wabash students live by one rule: The student is expected to conduct himself,                                           at all times, both on and off the campus, as a gentleman and a responsible citizen.           
http://www.wabash.edu	a			A personal context to teaching and learning
http://www.wabash.edu	div			            The College seeks to cultivate qualities of character and leadership in students                                           by developing not only their analytic skills, but also sensitivity to values, and                                            judgment and compassion required of citizens living in a difficult and uncertain world.

http://www.wabash.edu	strong			Athletics
http://www.wabash.edu	p			Wabash men love to compete â in their living units, classrooms, and especially on the playing field. Wabash won the first intercollegiate baseball, football, and basketball games ever played in Indiana, and we've been living up to our motto â Wabash Always Fights! â ever since. In the last seven years, Wabash men have won eight individual national championships, claimed 17 conference titles, and produced over 500 all-conference performances. And our student-athletes really are students â ten Little Giants have been named Academic All-Americans since 2011.

http://www.wabash.edu	h3			THE MODEL MAN
http://www.wabash.edu	p			Part of the Wabash ethos is the education of the model man, a philosophy distilled                                                   into a single code: 'The student is expected to conduct himself at all times, both on                                                    and off the campus, as a gentleman and responsible citizen.' Nuff said... The code is a                                                     very real part of student life, from academics to the athletic fields.

http://www.wabash.edu	p			Wabash students are probably ten times smarter and better prepared for                                                   post-graduate life than students at other schools.

http://www.wabash.edu	h3			NO WHERE ELSE
http://www.wabash.edu	p			This is a clan with elan. Not a single student I talked to would be anywhere else.                                                   Wabash was their first choice, and one reason was they'd been told, 'It won't be easy,                                                    but it will be worth it.'
