All applications for Admission to Webb Institute are reviewed initially by the Office of Admissions and Student Affairs and then again by the Admissions Committee. The Admissions Committee consists of:
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	li			President Keith Michel

https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	li			Dean Matthew Werner
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	li			Professor Elena Goloubeva
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	li			Professor Richard Harris

https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	p			Due to the strength of Webb’s Early Decision pool as well as Webb’s small size, not all qualified candidates can be accepted in the Early Decision round. Typically, Webb admits approximately one third of the class in Early Decision.

https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	p			Due to Webb’s small size and high yield rate, very few students above and beyond the targeted number of incoming students (28) are accepted to Webb.  Because of this, Webb typically plans on using the waitlist to complete the class.  In the past three years, between zero and four candidates have been admitted off the waitlist.  If you are waitlisted, you can always send additional information to the admissions office.  This can include updated grades, updated test scores, accomplishments since submitting the application, an additional letter of recommendation, etc. However, please note that the Admissions Committee reserves the right to make final decisions on waitlisted applications prior to receiving additional information. Materials received after a final decision will not affect that decision.

https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	p			The Admissions Committee communicates with applicants primarily through email, and at times by the preferred phone number listed on the Common Application. It is the applicant’s responsibility to update Webb immediately with a new email address if needed. Failure to check or update your email may result in you missing key information, which could jeopardize your admission and/or place in the class. Please note that Webb is not responsible for any technological issues (including email filters, etc.) that prevent applicants from receiving our communications.
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Deferred Admission/Leave of Absence

https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Final Decisions
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	p			The Admissions Committee reserves the right to release a decision at any time during the application process. Students may choose to appeal the process if new information was received after.
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Mandatory Orientation 
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	p			Successful completion of Webb’s orientation is a prerequisite for enrollment at Webb. Orientation is scheduled the week before the start of classes.
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Transfer Credits, AP Scores, IB Scores, etc.
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/apply	p			Webb does not accept any transfer credits and does not provide credits for any AP or IB exams.  All students begin their experience at Webb as first semester Freshmen.

Please note that your financial aid eligibility is based on your current enrollment status and may be subject to change based on final verification of your information. A student’s financial aid package is contingent upon federal, state, and institutional appropriations and regulations. If you are selected for a process called verification, you are required to provide Webb Institute all documents requested. Any changes made to the award as a result of verification will be stated in a revised award letter.
https://www.webb.edu/admissions/tuition	p			Any change of circumstance, change of address, or receipt of external funding, must be reported to the Office of Financial Aid. Webb Institute reserves the right to revoke any aid offer if there is any evidence that the conditions of enrollment status, financial need, or merit are not met. Changes in enrollment, including non-attendance or withdrawals, may reduce or cancel this aid offer. Canceled awards will not be replaced with other aid.
