https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	strong		br	Transfer Credit Policies
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			 A limited number of transfer credits for M.A.C.E. and M.Div. students may be accepted for work completed within the past eight years at accredited institutions.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			Work must have been done at a school accredited by the Association of Theological Schools (ATS) in the U.S. or Canada, or at an institutions offering graduate-level work accredited by one of the nationally recognized regional accrediting agencies in the U.S. Union Presbyterian Seminary reserves the right to deny transfer credit for courses taken at institutions that do not meet its accreditation standards.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			Students who receive transfer credit for all required courses in any academic department are required to take at least one elective course in that department (biblical studies, theology and ethics, history, education, and practical theology).
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			Transfer students must earn at least half of the credits required for their degree at Union Presbyterian Seminary, including at least two credits in supervised ministry for M.Div. students.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			Students transferring into the Dual degree program must spend a minimum of three years enrolled in the program in order to receive the degrees.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			Union Presbyterian Seminary does not accept for transfer credit courses that were offered solely through a “correspondence” format, and considers for transfer only those distance-learning courses for which it can be established, in the judgment of the associate dean, or the dean of Union Presbyterian Seminary, Charlotte campus, that peer and student-faculty interaction met or exceeded standards maintained in Union Presbyterian Seminary courses.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			Credits that have already been applied toward an earned degree cannot ordinarily be transferred.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	strong		br	Transfer Credits Procedure
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			 By the end of their first term following matriculation at Union Presbyterian Seminary, transfer students must by written notice to the registrar initiate requests to transfer course credits earned prior to attending Union Presbyterian Seminary.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			The student is responsible to provide the registrar with documentation of the content of each course proposed for transfer.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			The registrar will assemble a packet of proposed transfer materials for the student and submit it to those determining acceptance of the credits.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			The associate dean, or the dean of Union Presbyterian Seminary, Charlotte campus, as is applicable, the chair of the department into which the transfer of credit is requested, and the registrar will review the packet and determine the acceptability of transfer credits and decide the student’s remaining degree requirements.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	em			Transferability of credits to be earned through study at another school (including a Richmond Theological Consortium school), after a student has enrolled at Union Presbyterian Seminary, should first be investigated with the registrar, who will consult with the associate dean for academic programs or dean of Union Presbyterian Seminary, Charlotte campus, before the student commences study at the other school.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			Even if you are applying using the online application, you may need to print out additional forms, fill them out by hand, and mail them.

https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			The Admissions Office recognizes that personal integrity, emotional health, and spiritual maturity are essential to faithful and effective ministry. Yet we affirm that even serious misdeeds have sometimes been a part of an experience of growth, transformation, and call, by the work of God’s Spirit that leads a person to seminary, and to faithful ministry. We also realize that people come to the attention of criminal justice systems for a variety of reasons-including not only the commission of crimes but also mistaken allegations, acts of civil disobedience, and systemic injustices such as racism. No charge or past offense automatically disqualifies an applicant from admission. All records will be evaluated in context, and prior to an admission decision.

https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			 The faculty has approved the following exceptions to our academic policies, in this particular situation, to support current BTSR students who would like to be admitted to and complete their degree at our seminary:
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			a. UPSem will allow 2/3 of our degree program requirements to be fulfilled by BTSR courses. (Our policies allow 1/2.)
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			b. UPSem will accept transfer credits for online courses. (Our policies disallow online courses to transfer in.)
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			c. UPSem will accept transfer credits for courses that have been taken on a pass/fail basis, but only as elective credits toward the completion of a degree from our seminary. (Our policies disallow pass/fail courses to transfer in, with the exception of Clinical Pastoral Education courses.)
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			d. To guide BTSR students and our Registrar’s office in viewing how BTSR courses will count toward our degree requirements, course maps for the M.Div. and M.A.T.S. degree programs have been approved by our faculty. These are the only programs available to current BTSR students who would like to enroll at our seminary, transfer BTSR course credits, and complete their degrees at our seminary.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p			Other academic policies regarding the transfer of courses, such as the minimum grade for a course that is eligible to transfer in, still apply.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now	p		a	For any questions regarding the transferability of BTSR courses, please contact the Registrar’s Office directly: Stan Hargraves (

https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	h3			How do I access a new application?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p			In most cases, you can access an application directly by going to the school’s own website and following the link to submit an application.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	h3			How do I access an application I already started?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p		a	Once you’ve begun an application, you can either return to the school’s website and follow the submit an application link to continue your work on your application in progress, or you can come directly to the CollegeNET site and access any in-progress applications from your

https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	h3			How do I fill out an application?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p			Once you have a CollegeNET account, you can begin filling out a school application. You can either complete the application and submit it in one sitting, or save your work and continue it at a later time. When filling out your application:
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	li			To save what you have done so far without exiting, click the Save button.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	li			To save and exit, click the Finish Session or Save and Exit button.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	li		a	To access an application in progress and continue your work on it, either go to your 
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	li			 and select the application, or access the application directly from the school’s website.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	strong			How do I submit an application?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p			Check your work carefully. When you are satisfied with it and are ready to send it to us, click the send button at the bottom of the last page. This saves your answers in their final form and takes you to the payment page where you pay your application fee online (or apply for a fee waiver, if that option is available).
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	div			 Your application is not fully submitted until you pay your application fee and it has been authorized (see below), or until you have submitted a fee waiver request and it was granted.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	h3			How do I pay my application fee?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p		a	On the payment page, you can pay your application fee by debit/credit card or check (note that electronic checks must be from US bank accounts only). If you are paying by check, see these 
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	a			instructions
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	div			 Once payment is authorized, your application is final, and you can no longer make changes to it.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	h3			How secure is my payment transaction?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p			Your debit/credit card information is encrypted during transmission from your browser to our server and during payment authorization. None of your debit/credit card information is stored in our database.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	h3			What are fee waivers?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p			A fee waiver means that the school will accept an application without payment. There are several different kinds of fee waivers, and all of them have the same end result: they allow you to complete your application and submit it without entering any payment information (such as a credit card number). In some cases, you will need to enter a waiver code into the form, and the application fee will then be changed to /usr/local/applyweb/modperl-bin/instruct. In other cases, the waiver is automatic, and you won’t see any fee at all. Or, you can submit a fee waiver request with your application, and the school will review your request and let you know whether they accepted or denied it, and send a message letting you know either way. If your request was denied, you’ll need to submit payment before your application is officially submitted.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	h3			How do I submit my application if my fee has been waived?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p			If you have a waiver code, enter it on the form when asked. Or, if the fee was waived automatically by the school, you won’t even be asked for payment, and can simply submit your application. Finally, if you submit your form with a fee waiver request, the school will review your request and let you know whether they accepted or denied it, and you’ll receive a message letting you know either way. If your request was denied, you’ll need to submit payment before your application is officially submitted.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	h3			Is all my application data secure?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p			The information you enter is encrypted and secure when you save it and when you send it. Although general data collected on the system may be used in statistical studies and reports designed to assist institutions with planning, any information bearing your personal identification is disclosed only to the department to which you send it.
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	h3			How do I know if my application was received?
https://www.upsem.edu/admissions-aid/online-application	p		a	Check your Activity Log to print a copy of your form or to learn if we have received it. Your Activity Log is located
