http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	h1			Master's Admissions
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	p			You’ll appreciate the flexibility of our graduate programs before you even start.
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	p			As a master's student, you can apply — and be accepted — at any time. Courses are eight weeks long and are offered in six terms throughout the year. After filing an application, you can begin taking courses in the next term. Note, however, that there are deadlines for financial aid.
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	button			How to Apply
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	h2			Step 1: Complete the application
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	strong			Master's Program Requirements
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	p			To be considered, you must have an undergraduate degree from a regionally accredited institution, with a cumulative GPA of no less than 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	p			Students who have not met the 3.0 undergraduate cumulative GPA requirements or do not meet all of the program specific prerequisites are provided an opportunity to gain full acceptance. Depending on the degree program, additional information may be requested. In this case, students are provisionally admitted and limited to three courses of enrollment. To achieve full acceptance, provisional students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA in their first three graduate courses. Upon doing so, students are automatically converted to full acceptance status. If a provisional student fails to achieve a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA after completing three courses, then he or she will be academically dismissed, and will not be permitted to enroll in any further courses.
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	p			Although it is rare, Capitol Technology University reserves the right to request that an applicant take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) to be considered for admission.
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	a			Online Application Form
http://www.captechu.edu/admissions/masters	h2			Step 2: Submit your transcripts
