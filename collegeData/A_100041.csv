http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	h1			Admission Requirements
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			Ready to start your degree at AIU? We’ve streamlined the application and admissions process to make it simpler, faster and more convenient than ever.
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	h2			General Info
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			Our online application only takes 10-15 minutes to complete and our admissions advisors can guide you through the process if you need it. You can start now and return later to finish if necessary.
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	strong			Need Help?

http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			 with an Admissions Advisor
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	h2			Undergraduates
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	strong			Proof of High-School Graduation
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			You’ll need to provide proof that you graduated from high school or an equivalent program:
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	li			High-school transcript or diploma
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	li			GED transcript or certificate
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	strong			Proficiency in English & Math
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			We require proficiency in English and math for all undergraduates. If you haven’t shown that you’re a proficient English speaker, we’ll provide an assessment of one or both of those skills. This will help us determine your proper academic placement and whether you’ll need additional support services.
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	strong			Homeschooled Students
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			Homeschooled students and those who attended a high school not recognized per our admission policy must provide additional educational experience documentation.
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	h2			Requirements for Graduate Students
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	strong			College Accreditation
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			Your bachelor’s degree must have been earned at one of the following:
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	li			An institution accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	li			An internationally-recognized foreign institution of higher education
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	strong			College GPA
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			Your undergraduate transcript must show a GPA of 2.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale. AIU will verify your college GPA prior to your official acceptance into your Master’s degree program of study.
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	strong			International Transcripts
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			International students must have transcripts or academic records translated into English, at your own cost. Most U.S. Embassies and consulates can facilitate the process by evaluating your documents for U.S. equivalency.
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	strong			Non-Matriculating Graduate Admissions
http://www.aiuniv.edu/admissions/requirements	p			You can take graduate-level AIU courses as a non-matriculating student for one session while your official baccalaureate transcript is pending. Once we verify your documentation, you’ll automatically be given regular student status.
