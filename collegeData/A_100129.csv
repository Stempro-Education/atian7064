https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply	p		a	The application fee for Bates is $60, and can be submitted via the Common Application or Coalition Application. Eligible students can obtain and submit a fee waiver from the Common Application, Coalition Application, ACT, College Board, or NACAC.  Because the Common Application and the College Board offer a limited number of fee waivers per student, applicants are also able to ask a third party, such as a school counselor, to write on their behalf to request that the application fee be waived.  If the applicant chooses to ask a third party to write on their behalf, the applicant should select the last option on the Common App Fee Waiver list: “I can provide a supporting statement from a school official, college access counselor, financial aid officer, or community leader.” Additional eligibility guidelines for use of this waiver can be found 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply	p		a	The application fee is automatically waived for non-U.S. citizens applying to Bates for first-year admission – no requests for fee waivers or additional financial documents are needed. Non-U.S. citizens applying for financial aid and seeking transfer admission are eligible for a fee waiver. To receive a fee waiver code, please email Margaret Galligan-Schmoll at

https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	h3			Early Decision I & II
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	div		strong	For students who decide that “Bates is my first choice!,” applying Early Decision (ED) is a great option. 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	strong			ED is binding
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	div			: ED applicants who are admitted to Bates must withdraw all applications to other colleges. Bates offers two rounds of ED applications, ED1 and ED2.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	h4			What is the difference between EDI and EDII?
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p			The main difference between Early Decision I and Early Decision II is the application deadline.  The deadline for EDI is Nov. 15, and the EDII deadline is Jan. 1. This creates two pools of Early Decision applicants, and as a result students are considered in separate rounds of competition. Check with your college counselor to select the ED round that best suits your needs and school schedule.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	h4			Converting from Regular Decision or Early Decision II to Early Decision I
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p		a	Students who have applied under Regular Decision or Early Decision II and who wish to convert their application to Early Decision I can do so by filing an 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	a			Early Decision agreement 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p			by midnight on December 1. Applicants will receive notification of their admission decision by December 20.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	h4			Converting from Regular Decision to Early Decision II
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p		a	Students who have applied under Regular Decision and who wish to convert their application to Early Decision II can do so by filing an 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	a			Early Decision agreement
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p			 by midnight on February 1. Applicants will receive notification of their admission decision by February 15.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	h4			What if you’re not admitted under ED?
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p			Every year some Early Decision applicants are denied, but many students who are not admitted Early Decision are deferred for consideration in the Regular Decision applicant pool.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	h4			What about financial aid?
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p		a	If you are interested in 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	a			receiving financial assistance from Bates
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p		a	, you must submit a

https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	a			schedule for deadlines
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p		strong	. If admitted to Bates, you will receive a financial aid statement along with or shortly after your letter of admission. 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	strong			You must indicate that you wish to apply for aid at the time of application for admission.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p		a	Students who have been admitted and wish to request a gap year must do so by May 1.

https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	h3			Regular Decision
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	div		a	The application deadline for Regular Admission is January 1. Bates uses the 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	a			Common Application
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	div		a	. The Bates member page that requires an essay and a mid-year report. We strongly encourage families seeking 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	a			financial assistance
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	div		a	 to submit an application for aid as soon after the January 1 deadline as possible. The submission of standardized testing (the SAT I, SAT II and the ACT) is 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	strong			optional
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	div			in all rounds of admission.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p			Students who have applied under Regular Decision and who wish to convert their application to Early Decision I can do so by filing an Early Decision agreement by midnight on December 1. Students who have applied under Regular Decision and who wish to convert their application to Early Decision II can do so by filing an Early Decision agreement by midnight on February 1.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	em			Please note that Bates College does not offer January admission.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	h3			Transfer Admission
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	div			Each year we welcome applications from students who wish to transfer to Bates. We appreciate your interest in Bates and would like to help you determine if we’re a better fit for you.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p			We consider applications from students who have attended or are attending other institutions — including international students enrolled overseas.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/application-options	p		a	For the transfer applicant who hasn’t yet completed a second semester at another institution, the high school transcript remains critical. For all transfer applicants, both high school and college transcripts are considered.

https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/interviews	p			The interview is our best chance to meet the person behind the credentials. Don’t worry, we won’t put you on the spot with trick questions. Instead, we want to hear about your goals, strengths and growth opportunities. We want to know what’s made you the person you are.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/interviews	strong			Be prepared. 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/interviews	li		a	Read 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/interviews	a			our viewbook
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/interviews	li			, browse the website, and have some questions ready. We’ll want to know what sparked your interest in Bates and what you believe the college will offer you as a student and as a human being.
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/interviews	strong			Be yourself. 
https://www.bates.edu/admission/apply/interviews	li	li		Qualities such as thoughtfulness, intellectual curiosity and humor are much admired — don’t be afraid to wonder out loud about your dreams and what your future may hold. Don’t assume that you must have “all the answers” to life’s big questions. Just be ready to share your ideas and questions in a thoughtful and articulate fashion.
