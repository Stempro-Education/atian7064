http://blog.mghihp.edu/admission	a			Shout Out to PT Professionals for National Physical Therapy Month
http://blog.mghihp.edu/admission	div			"A note from Alex: It is National Physical Therapy Month. I am interrupting the series on ""The Impact of Impact"" and will follow up with Part III soon. In the meantime I wanted to acknowledge National Physical Therapy Month with a shout out to our own PT program. I also am taking this moment to express some thanks for special attention I have received from the PT profession over the past year or so. I don't usually use this blog for highly personal matters, but I am violating that rule today. In any case, I hope that you will join me in saluting and thanking our PT colleagues-faculty, students..."

http://blog.mghihp.edu/admission	a			The Value of Health Professions Education
http://blog.mghihp.edu/admission	div			"When speaking to all kinds of people about health profession education, I often get asked, ""Why do people get a master's degree in health professions education?"" or ""Sounds very interesting but where would it lead?"" I, of course, convey the passion and conviction I have for this field when answering these questions. I have also found one resource in particular to be extremely informative and helpful. It is a lot more unbiased than I am and most who read it, thank me for the reference! Anyway, it's a relatively brief analysis of ""the motivation and needs of 20 educator/clinicians in multiple..."

http://blog.mghihp.edu/admission	a			Compassionate Care
http://blog.mghihp.edu/admission	div			"As a health-care lawyer and son of a physician, Ken Schwartz thought he understood how care delivery worked. When he was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer in 1994, however, he unexpectedly gained a new perspective--that of a patient. He underwent CT scans, a bronchoscopy, exploratory surgery, and chemotherapy. Ken quickly realized that effective health care goes beyond knowing which tests to order or which drugs to administer. As he wrote before his death, ""What matters most is that they [the care givers] have empathized with me in a way that gives me hope and makes me feel like a human..."

http://blog.mghihp.edu/admission	a			Alum Helps Red Sox Win
http://blog.mghihp.edu/admission	div			One of the reasons why the Boston Red Sox won the 2013 World Series is due to the work of a man who never put on a uniform or faced a big league pitcher. Dan Dyrek, PT, DPT, a 2003 Doctor of Physical Therapy alumnus of MGH Institute of Health Professions, became Coordinator of Sports Medicine for the 2013 season after being a consultant the prior year. His mission: to work on keeping the players on the field and off the disabled list. Rob Bradford of WEEI.com recently wrote a story on Dr. Dyrek’s special relationship with designated hitter David Ortiz, who calls him a “genius” and credits him...
