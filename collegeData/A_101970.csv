https://cerc.uvi.edu	a			Fact Sheet
https://cerc.uvi.edu	h1			CARIBBEAN EXPLORATORY NIMHD RESEARCH CENTER
https://cerc.uvi.edu	h2			Who We Are
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p			The former named Nursing Division at the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) was awarded a grant (5P20MD002286) from the former National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities, now the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) which established the Caribbean Exploratory NIMHD Research Center for Excellence, hereafter referred to as the Caribbean Exploratory Research Center (CERC).
https://cerc.uvi.edu	h2			What We Do
https://cerc.uvi.edu	h3			The CERC will achieve its mission through the following:
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p		img	Research/Empowerment: Initiatives for reducing/eliminating health disparities; State of the science and practice; Research process and major research paradigms; and Research proposal development.
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p		br	 Mentoring: UVI has established collaborations with University of Colorado; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; Case Western Reserve University; Johns Hopkins University; Wayne State University.
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p		br	   Training: Research proposal development and submission for funding; poster presentations; and publications.
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p		br	   A very sparse literature suggests that residents of the U. S. Virgin Islands are burdened with the same health disparities identified in health disparity populations on the U. S. mainland. Few studies have described factors that might be associated with reported prevalence rates for health disparities in the territory.
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p			   The population of the U. S. Virgin Islands, while multicultural and diverse, is 76% black (African American, African Caribbean), 10% white, and 14% Hispanic. Access to care, lack of health insurance, low levels of education, high levels of poverty and a growing immigrant population may represent significant barriers to health care, health promotion, and prevention activities in the Virgin Islands.
https://cerc.uvi.edu	h2			Our Success - How CERC Works
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p			The planning and implementation for the CERC is achieved through four (4) Cores. Each Core has a University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) faculty member as a director, who is partnered with one or more faculty or community member as co-directors. The co-directors are consultants and/or mentors, proving advice and support based on their breadth of experience as faculty members, or community leaders in the healthcare and scientific communities.
https://cerc.uvi.edu	h3			The Cores are made up of the following:
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p		br	Administrative;
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p		br	   Community Engagement & Outreach;
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p		br	   Research;
https://cerc.uvi.edu	p			   Research Education & Training.

You might not even realize it, but you have the power to change the way you think and see the world. And, now, with your college degree, you have the power to change it too. You are making a big change in your life and you deserve the college to support you with your own personal coach to make it happen!
https://online.uvi.edu/admissions	strong			Technical Support: 
https://online.uvi.edu/admissions	p			24×7 access to tutorials, FAQs, and Help Desk Hours to get you through hardware and software challenges
https://online.uvi.edu/admissions	strong			Academics: 
https://online.uvi.edu/admissions	p			Our goal is for you to start a degree program where you’ll want to stay. That goal is ingrained in everything we do, even in program design. Did you know that every single online course in your program is developed by a team of experts? Our team consists of multiple faculty, instructional designers, outside subject experts, and even employers! That’s how much we take care in each step of your student experience.
https://online.uvi.edu/admissions	p			Once you are in a course, you are again surrounded by your UVI team of professionals: your student-life coach, your faculty, your peers, and an IT Help Desk, just to name a few. Your faculty professionals have real-world experience in addition to their academic credentials. And if you are starting back to college after a long break, we place you in specific courses that are designed with success tools to get you comfortable with things you may have not been exposed to in a while –  like formal academic writing or reading large amounts of text.
https://online.uvi.edu/admissions	p			We believe in supporting you so much, that we designed the courses and the support experience with you, the busy adult in mind. And, we take it one step further. We know that even champions need a break. We believe you need down time. So, we built in breaks or “mini-vacations” into your academic year so that you can refresh and rejuvenate.
