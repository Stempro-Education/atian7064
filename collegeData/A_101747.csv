http://www.ucsf.edu/education/admissions	p			Congratulations on your decision to apply to UC San Francisco!
http://www.ucsf.edu/education/admissions	p			UCSF is the leading university exclusively focused on health. The University comprises top-ranked professional schools of dentistry, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy; as well as a graduate division with world-renowned programs in basic science, social/populational sciences and physical therapy.
http://www.ucsf.edu/education/admissions	p			UCSF is unique in that it only offers graduate degrees (meaning it does not have an undergraduate student population). To apply to UCSF, you must follow the admissions process specific to the school or program in which you are applying.
