https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	a			registrar1@fvsu.edu.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	h2			Readmission Application Deadline Dates:
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	li			Spring – December 1

https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	li			Fall – June 15
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	h2			Fort Valley State University Academic Renewal
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	p		a	The Academic Renewal policy allows University System of Georgia degree-seeking students who have experienced academic difficulty at an institution to have one final opportunity to earn an undergraduate degree at a system institution after an absence of three calendar years from any postsecondary institution.  Upon re-enrolling, a student must petition for academic renewal within three academic semesters or within one calendar year, whichever comes first.  Please contact the Office of the Registrar at 
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	a			Registrar1@fvsu.edu
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	p			 for additional information.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	h3			Requirements:
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			Academic Renewal can be granted only once. 
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			Academic credit for previously completed coursework will be retained only for courses in which an A, B or C grade was earned.  Retained grades will not be calculated in the Academic Renewal GPA but will be counted in Academic Renewal hours earned.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			Courses with D or F grades must be repeated at Fort Valley State University if they are required in the degree program. 
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			Following the granting of academic renewal, all remaining courses for the current degree must be completed at Fort Valley State University, unless the student receives prior approval to take a course at another institution.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			To earn a degree, the residency policy at Fort Valley State University after acquiring academic renewal status must be met.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			Applicability of retained credit to degree requirements will be determined by the degree requirements currently in effect at the time Academic Renewal status is approved.  Also, all institutional program requirements must be met.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			After receiving academic renewal status, all work completed toward a degree must be calculated in the GPA in order for a student to be eligible for honors at graduation.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			The granting of Academic Renewal does not supersede financial aid policies regarding Satisfactory Academic Progress.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			The granting of Academic Renewal may supersede the admissions requirements of certain program which require a specific minimum grade point average based on all course work.  Therefore, the Dean will be responsible for the evaluation process for admissions. 
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			An Academic Renewal grade point average will begin when resuming coursework following the three-year period of absence once Academic Renewal is granted.  A statement will be placed on the transcript indicating Academic Renewal status.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			The Academic Renewal grade point average will be used for determining academic standing and eligibility for graduation.
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			Transfer credits earned at another institution can be granted for coursework completed during my absence from Fort Valley State University if applicable to my degree program. 
https://www.fvsu.edu/readmission	span			Academic credit from a previously attended institution can be evaluated for Academic Renewal, if there is no enrollment for three calendar years from the previously attended institution(s).
