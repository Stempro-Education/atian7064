http://www.barclaycollege.edu/apply/online	div		br	                     Barclay College Online welcomes transfer students. Those desiring to transfer to Barclay must complete an application for admission and should furnish a transcript of all college work previously taken for credit. Normally, transfer students are accepted only with evidence of an honorable withdrawal.                     
http://www.barclaycollege.edu/apply/online	div		br	                     In the acceptance of transfer credits the college will be guided by the prescribed policy of the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE).                     
http://www.barclaycollege.edu/apply/online	div			                     Credits are accepted for relevant subjects from accredited members of ABHE and from other schools accredited by recognized institutional and professional agencies on the basis of the equivalency for work of a C grade or higher. Credits from nonaccredited, nonmember schools are accepted only on the basis of sound validation. Final validation of transcripts of transfer students from nonaccredited schools will be withheld until satisfactory completion of approximately 30 semester hours at Barclay College.
