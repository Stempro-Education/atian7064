https://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p			Hobart and William Smith Colleges seek students with a  passion for learning. We want you to  expand your interests and see the world from multiple perspectives. You’ll be guided along the way by a faculty  with a passion for teaching and a desire to help you reach your goals.
https://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p			Prior to college, we expect that you have chosen a rigorous  high school curriculum and have applied your talents to the betterment of your  school and community. We’ll carefully  review your application, transcript, essay and recommendations. Many of the characteristics we value are not  well identified through examination of standardized test scores, therefore you  will have the option of whether we use those scores (SAT or ACT) when you apply  for admission to Hobart and William Smith.

https://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	h3			Deferred Admission
https://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p			Students who have been accepted for admission may petition to delay the start of their academic career at HWS provided that they have communicated this desire to the admissions office prior to submitting their enrollment down payment. A student should give written notice to their admissions counselor prior to their enrollment down payment deadline. This notice should detail what the student plans to do in the interim and address how the break in their schooling will enhance the applicant’s future experience at HWS, advance their personal growth and/or contribute significantly to their community. If the deferral is approved, The Colleges will require an enrollment down payment by the payment deadline to hold the candidate’s space in a future class. Deferral requests will not be accepted after the enrollment down payment deadline of January 15 for early decision applicants and May 1 for regular decision applicants.  The enrollment down payment is posted to the student’s upcoming first term, and is applied as a payment to their first semester bill.  Please note that should a student decide not to matriculate into the Colleges, the enrollment down payment is forfeited.

We encourage applicants to stand up for what they believe in.
https://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	h2			Demonstrated Interest
https://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p		a	As prospective students try to find colleges that are a good match for them, our admissions office is trying to find students who are a good match for HWS.  Accordingly we welcome any and all opportunities to meet with students

https://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p		a	, at their

https://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	a			campus visit
https://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p			, we understand that it may not be possible for every prospective student to make it to Hobart and William Smith. We do hope those who do not make the trip to Geneva, N.Y. will look for other opportunities to interact with our staff, faculty, students and alumni/ae.

The field experiences offer students exposure to the real aspects of being a teacher. The supportive faculty helped me grow as a student and as a future educator. At a time when our national education system is evolving, I feel confident and grateful for the professors who guided me.

From the matriculation ceremonies at Orientation through the Hobart Launch and William Smith Alumnae Welcome at graduation, each College celebrates its own traditions and heritage.  Hobart College and William Smith College also maintain their own deans, student governments and athletic departments.

http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p			Hobart and William Smith Colleges seek students with a  passion for learning. We want you to  expand your interests and see the world from multiple perspectives. You’ll be guided along the way by a faculty  with a passion for teaching and a desire to help you reach your goals.
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p			Prior to college, we expect that you have chosen a rigorous  high school curriculum and have applied your talents to the betterment of your  school and community. We’ll carefully  review your application, transcript, essay and recommendations. Many of the characteristics we value are not  well identified through examination of standardized test scores, therefore you  will have the option of whether we use those scores (SAT or ACT) when you apply  for admission to Hobart and William Smith.

http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	h3			Deferred Admission
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p			Students who have been accepted for admission may petition to delay the start of their academic career at HWS provided that they have communicated this desire to the admissions office prior to submitting their enrollment down payment. A student should give written notice to their admissions counselor prior to their enrollment down payment deadline. This notice should detail what the student plans to do in the interim and address how the break in their schooling will enhance the applicant’s future experience at HWS, advance their personal growth and/or contribute significantly to their community. If the deferral is approved, The Colleges will require an enrollment down payment by the payment deadline to hold the candidate’s space in a future class. Deferral requests will not be accepted after the enrollment down payment deadline of January 15 for early decision applicants and May 1 for regular decision applicants.  The enrollment down payment is posted to the student’s upcoming first term, and is applied as a payment to their first semester bill.  Please note that should a student decide not to matriculate into the Colleges, the enrollment down payment is forfeited.

http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p			Part of leading a life of consequence is participation in active citizenship. Peacefully exercising your right to protest will not jeopardize admission to Hobart and William Smith, even if you are disciplined or suspended. We encourage applicants to stand up for what they believe in.
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	h2			Demonstrated Interest
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p		a	As prospective students try to find colleges that are a good match for them, our admissions office is trying to find students who are a good match for HWS.  Accordingly we welcome any and all opportunities to meet with students 
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	a			on-campus
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p		a	, at their 
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	a			schools

http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	a			hometowns
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p		a	 and online.  Substantial Interaction with an admissions staff member may positively impact our final admissions decision. While we highly recommend a 
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	a			campus visit
http://www.hws.edu/admissions/apply_application.aspx	p			, we understand that it may not be possible for every prospective student to make it to Hobart and William Smith. We do hope those who do not make the trip to Geneva, N.Y. will look for other opportunities to interact with our staff, faculty, students and alumni/ae.
