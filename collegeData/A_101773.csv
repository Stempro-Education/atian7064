http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	h2			Certificate Programs
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	h2		UF offers many certificate programs that enable students to learn advanced skills in a specialized course of study. Certificate programs have fewer courses and requirements than a degree program. Applicants may learn more about certificate admission requirements on the departmental website.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	p		In the certificate application process, the Office of Admissions must complete the following review before your application is referred to your department:
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	li			Determination of satisfactory conduct record
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	li	li		Application fee payment of $30
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	li	li		Validation of transcripts and degrees
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	li	li		Verification of residency classification
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	ul		The Office of Admissions cannot forward an application to a certificate program to the department until all materials and transcript(s) have been received.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	p	a	For currently enrolled UF students, 
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	a			apply here.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	p		 You will need your GatorLink username and password to apply.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	p	a	For new students, 
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	h2			Readmission
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	h2		Readmission applies only to students who have previously been enrolled in an undergraduate, graduate, post-baccalaureate or professional UF program. Former students who do not enroll at the university for two consecutive terms, including any summer term, must apply for readmission at the same level of their previous enrollment. Students who skip a single term will be scheduled automatically for a registration appointment for one additional term.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	a			Learn More
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	h2			Post-baccalaureate Admissions
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	h2		Post-baccalaureate study is for students who have already received a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution. Students interested in post-baccalaureate study typically take undergraduate courses in order to fulfill requirements for professional school, teacher certification, prerequisites for graduate study, or licensure/certification. Because UF has limited space available for post-baccalaureate studies, applicants should communicate intentions with their proposed department before applying.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	p		Post-baccalaureate admission differs from standard graduate admissions. In the post-baccalaureate application process, the Office of Admissions must complete the following review before your application is referred to your department:
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	li			Validation of transcripts and degrees
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	li	li		Receipt of official test scores from the testing agency
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	li	li		Determination of satisfactory conduct record
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	ul		The Office of Admissions cannot forward an application to a post-baccalaureate program to the department until all materials and transcript(s) have been received. After referral, the department will mail admission notifications directly to applicants.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	h2			Non-Degree Seeking Students
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	h2		Undergraduate students in good standing at another accredited collegiate institution can enroll full time at UF as non-degree transient students to complete work to transfer back to the parent institution. The university has no available space for transient students during the fall and spring semesters; transient students should plan to take courses at UF during the summer terms only (A, B or C).
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	p		UF will not evaluate work previously completed, and it is the student's responsibility to secure approvals required by the parent institution. Certification to Social Security and Veterans Administration programs also is the responsibility of the student, who must request each institution to furnish records.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	p	a	Non-degree students are subject to these 
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	a			restrictions.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more	p	p		Non-degree enrollment is subject to the availability of faculty, space and facilities.

http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	p	h2		Each school year, there are numerous things you can do to help prepare yourself for college. Even though high school graduation may be years away, it is never too early to begin learning about what it takes to get accepted into the college of your choice.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	h2			Grades 7 & 8
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li			In middle school, you may be offered the opportunity to take some high-school level courses (for example, Algebra 1, physical science, or a foreign language). These courses will count for high school graduation and for college admission consideration.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li	abbr	What are your interests and skills? This is a time to begin thinking about what type of extracurricular activities you might wish to pursue in high school. How you spend your time outside the classroom is an important consideration in 
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li		's admissions process.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li		What are your favorite subjects? Start thinking now about matching your academic talents with a possible college major and eventual career discipline.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li		Involve your family. Parents, guardians, siblings and school counselors all can help you and offer advice on staying on the right path.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	h2			Grades 9 & 10
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	p	h2		Arrange your class schedule so you will complete the following college preparatory classes during high school:
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li		strong	English (with substantial writing) – 
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	strong			4 Units
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li	strong	Math (Algebra I, Algebra II, Formal Geometry, and additional math beyond Algebra II) – 
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li	strong	Natural Science (2 units must include a laboratory) –

http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li	strong	Social Science – 
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li	strong	Foreign Language (two sequential years in same language) – 
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	strong			2 Units
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li	strong	Total Units – 
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	strong			16* Units
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	p	ul		The university recommends that you complete at least four additional units of electives in these core disciplines. The more academic units you complete, the more competitive your application.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	p	p		Start taking academically challenging courses such as Honors and AP, Pre-IB and IB, Pre-AICE and AICE, or Dual Enrollment.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li			Explore careers and jobs you find interesting. Talk with professionals in those fields and find out what kind of education is required, as well as what colleges offer those majors.

http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	abbr			PSAT
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	abbr			PreACT

http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	abbr			ACT
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li		, respectively.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li		Talk to your parents about your plans for college.
http://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/plan	li	li		If you are a Florida resident, ask your counselor for information about the Bright Futures scholarship.
