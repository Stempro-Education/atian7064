https://jcu.edu/applynow	h2			Admission Requirements
https://jcu.edu/applynow	div			Admission Criteria
https://jcu.edu/applynow	p			When looking at your application, we want to know you. We don’t just focus on your GPA or test scores. Our staff engages in a holistic review process, meaning we review everything that is submitted as part of your application so that we get a well-rounded view of you and your accomplishments. We want to be confident that JCU is a place where you can succeed academically and contribute to our campus. In addition to your high school record and ACT/SAT test scores, we carefully consider your extracurricular involvement, your essay, and your letter(s) of recommendation.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	p			We also want to attract students of diverse economic, racial, and religious backgrounds to John Carroll, to maintain wide geographic representation in each class, and to actively seek significant talents of all kinds.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	p			In order to enroll at John Carroll University, you must have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. Upon enrollment, a final high school transcript is required in order to confirm your graduation from high school.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	strong			Have a unique situation or circumstance? 
https://jcu.edu/applynow	p			Please be sure to tell us about it either in person, with a staff member, or in writing as a part of your application.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	div			High School Curriculum

https://jcu.edu/applynow	p		a	Whether you have taken Advanced Placement (AP) coursework, courses in an International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum, or you have already completed some college courses while in high school, please visit our 
https://jcu.edu/applynow	a			credit evaluation page
https://jcu.edu/applynow	p			 to see how this credit will be evaluated.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	div			Essay
https://jcu.edu/applynow	p			There is one required essay as part of the application process for John Carroll University. As part of The Common Application, you will be able to upload your essay. The prompt directly from The Common Application is as follows:
https://jcu.edu/applynow	em			The essay demonstrates your ability to write clearly and concisely on a selected topic and helps you distinguish yourself in your own voice. What do you want the readers of your application to know about you apart from courses, grades, and test scores? Choose the option that best helps you answer that question and write an essay of no more than 650 words, using the prompt to inspire and structure your response. Remember: 650 words is your limit, not your goal. Use the full range if you need it, but don’t feel obligated to do so. (The application won’t accept a response shorter than 250 words.)
https://jcu.edu/applynow	strong			Essay Prompts 
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			Describe a problem you’ve solved or a problem you’d like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma – anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you’ve already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	a			Home-Schooled Students
https://jcu.edu/applynow	a			Score Choice
https://jcu.edu/applynow	h3			Home-Schooled Students
https://jcu.edu/applynow	p			Since some students in home-school programs do not follow a traditional high school curriculum, we ask that all home-school students provide us, during the application process, with complete and detailed documentation of their high school coursework and evaluations of progress from an approved home-school evaluator or supervisor.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	p			Verification of high school graduation must be submitted prior to enrollment at John Carroll, and can be presented through any of the following forms:
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			A diploma from a home-school agency governed by a State Board of Education;
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			A letter from a local school district verifying graduation; or
https://jcu.edu/applynow	li			A copy of the Graduate Equivalency Diploma (GED) transcript.
https://jcu.edu/applynow	h3			Score Choice
https://jcu.edu/applynow	p			Regarding the College Board’s optional Score Choice feature, John Carroll University does allow score choice, but you are encouraged to submit all test scores as we superscore standardized test scores (for both ACT and SAT) — if a student takes the SAT multiple times and sends us multiple scores, we will take the applicant’s highest section scores across all SAT test dates that are submitted to create a new, potentially higher superscore. We will do the same with the ACT.
