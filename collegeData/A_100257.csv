http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	span			Get ahead with transfer credits
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	p		br	You’ve already put a lot of hard work into your studies. Learn how   you can potentially save time and money on your Capella degree by   transferring credits from an accredited university.
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	h3		br	The transfer credit process
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	p		br	To find out if your previous university credits will apply to your   Capella program, there are three steps to the process:
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	strong			Step One | Obtain your official transcripts
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	p		br	As part of your application, you have the option to give Capella   permission to request your official transcripts from other schools on   your behalf.*
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	span			*Capella will not be able to obtain your     transcript if there is a hold on your record from another university.
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	strong			Step Two | Capella evaluation
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	p			Your previous coursework will be evaluated based on applicability to   degree requirements, grade earned, and how closely it matches our   courses per department, title, level, credits, and description of   course content. Courses without a direct Capella match may be   evaluated as electives in programs that include electives.*
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	span		a	*Note: Degree levels and programs have     maximum transfer credit limits. See 
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	a			Transfer Credit and Prior Learning Assessment     Policy
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	span			 for details.
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	strong			Step Three | Summary of evaluation
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	p			You’ll receive an email with a summary of the courses that have been   accepted for transfer, typically within a week of receiving all of   your transcripts.
http://www.capella.edu/admissions/transfers	p		br	Work with your enrollment counselor if you have questions about your   evaluation or if you wish to explore options for any non-accepted   credits.
