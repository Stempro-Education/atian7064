https://www.cambridgecollege.edu	div			A new partnership between Cambridge College, Mel King Institute for Community Building, and Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation (MGCC) has formed an innovative program that will educate small business development officers throughout the Commonwealth. The program will help accelerate the start up and growth of small businesses from under-invested communities served by MGCC. The partners will offer the first cycle of this program starting in January 2020 to professionals that work at community development corporations, community development finance institutes and other non-profit community-based organizations that help entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses. These non-profit organizations focus specifically on businesses led by people of color, immigrants and women as well as businesses located in lower income urban and rural areas.
