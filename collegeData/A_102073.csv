https://www.wgu.edu	h3			WGU Frequently Asked Questions.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			"Is this program truly ""at your own pace""?"
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU offers flexible pacing, meaning you can move through courses at a pace that meets your learning style and knowledge level.  Students can go as fast as they can but not as slowly.  Students are required to complete a minimum number of competency units per term to meet on-time progress. However, if you choose to study at 3 am daily, that we can accommodate. 
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Do all my existing credits transfer to WGU?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU has a generous transfer policy. Our transcripts department can accept official copies of transcripts from your previous educational institutions for a course-by-course evaluation that compares the context of your courses to those in our programs, to tell you what is comparable and transferable.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			How quickly can you finish the program?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Your personal progress will be determined by the extent of your transfer units, your time commitment, and your determination to proceed at a faster rate. Traditionally, without an associate’s degree or equivalent, it will take 2 to 2.5 years.  Master's degree programs are designed to be completed within 2 years.  However, we work on a competency-based model, which gives you credit for passing assessments and proving you can perform a task or understand a course of study proficiently. 
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Can you skip ahead if you get done early?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Yes! If you are able to complete the minimum requirement before your term is over, you can add more courses, with no tuition increase.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Does WGU offer financial aid?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU is approved to offer federal student aid. You will need to apply using the FAFSA, which is used to determine your eligibility for aid. WGU’s FAFSA school code is 033394.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Is WGU accredited?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Yes! WGU is regionally accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), the highest form of accreditation.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			How do WGU courses compare to classes in traditional schools?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU offers competency-based education. Competency-based learning means our online degrees are based on real-world competencies as opposed to seat time or credit hours.  Our focus in on ensuring you possess the skills and knowledge you need to be successful, not whether you’ve attended class or not.  If you already have knowledge in an area a course covers, you’ll be able to draw upon this experience to complete assessments faster, ultimately saving you both time and money.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Does WGU offer job placement?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU students and alumni have access to career services which include professional development, career exploration, and career planning. WGU also has partner employers who share full-time, part-time, and paid internship opportunities.

https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			WGU seeks to admit individuals who have the capacity and determination to complete a rigorous WGU degree program … and graduate. The admission process is designed to help you and the university reach an informed decision about your likelihood of success.
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	em			“From the very beginning, the whole process was very smooth. My enrollment counselors were knowledgeable and helpful. If I did run into any kind of little snag, somebody was always there to help me.”

https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	h3			Programs begin the first of every month.
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			WGU offers degrees, not classes. Instead of semesters that start two or three times a year, WGU starts new students at the beginning of each month, which launches a new term for those students.
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			A term at WGU is six months long. The six months that make up your term are based on when you begin your program. (For example, if you begin your program March 1, your first term lasts from March 1 through August 31. Your second term would begin September 1.)
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			Tuition is billed at a flat rate every term. You pay for the time, not by credit hour or by course.

https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	h3			Admissions FAQs
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			What if English isn’t my first language?
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		a	As a WGU student, you will be expected to communicate clearly in writing and during conversations with your mentor and WGU staff. If English is not your native language, you will need to submit proof of a qualifying score on the internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language Test (TOEFL iBT). WGU requires a qualifying score of 80 or higher. WGU’s TOEFL code is 3949. 
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	a	a		Speak to an Enrollment Counselor
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		a	 to get additional information. (For more information specifically on the TOEFL, 
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	a	a		visit the TOEFL website
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			Will you admit students living outside the U.S.?
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			At the present time, WGU is accepting applications only from individuals living in the United States. (The exceptions are U.S. active-duty military personnel and their families at overseas installations and individuals living in Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.)
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		a	Unfortunately, we have discovered we cannot always guarantee that the educational experience for students living outside the United States will meet our high standards for quality and convenience. It is our expectation that these problems will be solved in future years. An 
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	a			Enrollment Counselor
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			 has more information about which areas are eligible to submit applications.
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			What if my prior college was outside the U.S.?
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		a	Applicants who have completed coursework outside of the United States must provide one copy of official transcripts or certified true copies with official English translation of all documents. Applicants are responsible for submitting transcripts that have been evaluated for U.S. equivalence. 
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	a			Click here for more information about international transfer credit evaluation.
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			What if my prior college no longer exists?
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			If you attended a college that no longer exists, you may be able to get transcripts from a state agency, such as a Department of Consumer Affairs or Department of Higher Education. If the college was taken over by another school, check with the current school. You can also submit any unofficial copies of transcripts or course records you may have, although we can’t promise that you will be able to waive any WGU requirements.
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			Do I have to pay the application fee to be admitted?
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		a	Yes. You may talk to an 
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		br	 without paying the application fee, but the fee must be paid before you can be admitted. The application fee helps defray our costs associated with admissions, transcript collection, enrolling students, etc. Note: It is against federal regulations to use financial aid for an application fee.

http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			WGU seeks to admit individuals who have the capacity and determination to complete a rigorous WGU degree program … and graduate. The admission process is designed to help you and the university reach an informed decision about your likelihood of success.
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	em			“From the very beginning, the whole process was very smooth. My enrollment counselors were knowledgeable and helpful. If I did run into any kind of little snag, somebody was always there to help me.”

http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	h3			Programs begin the first of every month.
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			WGU offers degrees, not classes. Instead of semesters that start two or three times a year, WGU starts new students at the beginning of each month, which launches a new term for those students.
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			A term at WGU is six months long. The six months that make up your term are based on when you begin your program. (For example, if you begin your program March 1, your first term lasts from March 1 through August 31. Your second term would begin September 1.)
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			Tuition is billed at a flat rate every term. You pay for the time, not by credit hour or by course.

http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			What if English isn’t my first language?
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		a	As a WGU student, you will be expected to communicate clearly in writing and during conversations with your mentor and WGU staff. If English is not your native language, you will need to submit proof of a qualifying score on the internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language Test (TOEFL iBT). WGU requires a qualifying score of 80 or higher. WGU’s TOEFL code is 3949. 
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	a	a		Speak to an Enrollment Counselor

http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			Will you admit students living outside the U.S.?
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			At the present time, WGU is accepting applications only from individuals living in the United States. (The exceptions are U.S. active-duty military personnel and their families at overseas installations and individuals living in Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.)
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		a	Unfortunately, we have discovered we cannot always guarantee that the educational experience for students living outside the United States will meet our high standards for quality and convenience. It is our expectation that these problems will be solved in future years. An 
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	a			Enrollment Counselor
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			 has more information about which areas are eligible to submit applications.
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			What if my prior college was outside the U.S.?
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		a	Applicants who have completed coursework outside of the United States must provide one copy of official transcripts or certified true copies with official English translation of all documents. Applicants are responsible for submitting transcripts that have been evaluated for U.S. equivalence.

http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			What if my prior college no longer exists?
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			If you attended a college that no longer exists, you may be able to get transcripts from a state agency, such as a Department of Consumer Affairs or Department of Higher Education. If the college was taken over by another school, check with the current school. You can also submit any unofficial copies of transcripts or course records you may have, although we can’t promise that you will be able to waive any WGU requirements.
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p			Do I have to pay the application fee to be admitted?
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		a	Yes. You may talk to an 
http://indiana.wgu.edu/admissions.html	p		br	 without paying the application fee, but the fee must be paid before you can be admitted. The application fee helps defray our costs associated with admissions, transcript collection, enrolling students, etc. Note: It is against federal regulations to use financial aid for an application fee.
