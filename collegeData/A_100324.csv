http://www.ccny.cuny.edu	p			The City College of New York (established as 'The Free Academy' in 1847) is the founding institution of the City University of New York and home to eight schools and divisions, each dedicated to the advancement of research and knowledge. We're the place where Albert Einstein first presented his theory of general relativity outside of Europe, our alumni discovered the polio vaccine, helped build the Internet, and designed the Panama Canal. And, our alumni have gone on to become Supreme Court Justices, Secretaries of State, leaders of industry, world-renowned researchers and award winning actors and musicians. We’re the City College of yesterday, today and tomorrow. See yourself here. City College
