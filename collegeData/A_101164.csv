https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	b			Deadline: Jan. 15, 2019 
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	p			We’d like to give you a chance to receive an additional $2,000 per year ($8,000 total) for simply taking the lead on your education. Submit your application and all required materials and your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by Jan. 15, 2019, and it’s yours. Here’s what to do:
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	li			Complete an application below
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	li			Send in your supplemental forms (i.e., high school transcript, test scores)
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	li			Complete your FAFSA and include Norwich University as one of your choices (003692). International students should instead complete the CSS Profile (3669).
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	a			Norwich App
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	div			      Start your Norwich application using the university's in-house form.     
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	a			Common App
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	div			      Apply to Norwich by submitting your national Common Application.     
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	p			Norwich reviews applicants based on the following criteria, in order of importance:
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Academic preparedness
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	p			We evaluate your application according to the major you plan to pursue. Norwich looks at your high-school transcript to make sure you are prepared for the rigors of the program. An ideal applicant will have completed the following:
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	li			Four years of English
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	li			Four years of math
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	li			Three to four years of laboratory science

https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	li			Two years of foreign language
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Résumé
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	p			It is advised, but not mandatory, to submit a résumé. Tell us about your activities, sports, volunteer work and leadership positions. We look for students who are motivated, value service to others and show initiative.
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Admissions essay
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	p			While optional, an essay strengthens your application. It should be short—one page is ideal. We recommend you use this essay to highlight something we don’t know about you.
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	strong			 Letters of recommendation
https://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	p			Letters from teachers, coaches, counselors, JROTC instructors or employers are optional but strongly recommended. Two is an ideal number.

http://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Admissions essay
http://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	p			While optional, an essay strengthens your application. It should be short—one page is ideal. We recommend you use this essay to highlight something we don’t know about you.

http://www.norwich.edu/admissions/apply	p			Letters from teachers, coaches, counselors, JROTC instructors or employers are optional but strongly recommended. Two is an ideal number.
