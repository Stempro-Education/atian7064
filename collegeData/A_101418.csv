https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h2			Admission to Saint Michael's College
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			Successful applicants for admission to Saint Michael’s College are typically very strong students who are active learners prepared for a rigorous intellectual experience. We’re especially interested in students who have a commitment to service, social justice and community.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			Saint Michael’s admission process is highly personalized and takes into account the entire student, from high school coursework and academic transcripts to extracurricular experiences, a personal essay, recommendations, and the campus visit. Because our admission procedure is so comprehensive, students are not required to submit standardized test scores.

https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	a			SAT/ACT Information
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h2			How Decisions Are Made
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			Saint Michael’s College’s admission standards are competitive. We review every application closely according to the following criteria outlined below, in order of importance.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	li			Overall high school record and strength of college preparatory curriculum (including the senior year of high school)
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	li			High school rank in class (in conjunction with the strength of curriculum elected and high school profile)
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	li			Application essay (required) and any submitted writing samples (optional)
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	li			Letters of recommendation from teachers, counselors, coaches and employers-generally two are sufficient
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	li			The applicant’s record of extracurricular interests, activities and talents
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	li			Campus Visit (This could be an Open House, Information Session and Campus Tour, or a Personal Interview.)
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p		strong	Saint Michael’s College is a 
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	strong			test-optional institution
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			. Applicants will be asked if they wish their scores to be considered. Any standardized testing scores (SAT or ACT) that are submitted will be used by the Admission staff during application review only if the student wishes them to be considered. If the question is not answered, the test scores will remain a part of the review.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h2			High School Requirements
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			Applicants should have at least 16 Carnegie Units of college preparatory course work in high school that includes some combination of the following (in order of importance):
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			Four years of English
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			While courses like speech and other English electives are interesting, we recommend those be taken in addition to (not as replacements for) English courses with a strong emphasis on writing and reading of literature.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			Two to three years of modern language
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			We require a minimum of two, but highly recommend that applicants pursue as many years of the same language as possible.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3		br	Three to four years of theoretical mathematics
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3		br	 Three to four years of science including at least 2 lab sciences
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			 Three to four years of history & social sciences
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			We recommend that you challenge yourself at the highest level of the coursework suitable to your abilities. The number of honors level and Advanced Placement courses that are in a student’s background are considered in our decision-making process.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h2			SAT/ACT Information
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			Is Saint Michael’s College a test-optional institution?
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p		strong	Yes. Therefore, you do not have to submit standardized test scores (SAT or ACT) to be considered for admission. All applicants, regardless of whether scores are submitted, will be considered for available merit based financial aid. However, 
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	strong			test scores are required to be considered for our most competitive merit scholarships
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			Do any programs require SAT or ACT scores?
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			Although Saint Michael’s College no longer requires standardized test scores for admission, the NCAA mandates the submission of standardized test scores for athletic eligibility. Thus, prospective student athletes should still take the SAT or ACT and submit their scores to the NCAA Clearinghouse.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			International students from non-English speaking countries are still required to submit the IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, or ACT.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			The Admissions Committee reserves the right to request test scores for any applicant.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			How do I send Saint Michael’s my official score report?
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			If you would like to send Saint Michael’s your official score report, be sure to list our code, 3757, on your SAT registration form or 4312 on your ACT registration form.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			If I choose to submit standardized test scores (SAT or ACT) how will they be used in admission decisions?
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			Submitting test scores is an option. Applicants will be asked if they wish to have their test scores considered. If the question is answered in the affirmative or left blank the submitted SAT/ACT scores will be used in the admission process as one of several factors.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			How do I know if I should submit my scores?
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			If a student believes that the test scores provide further evidence of academic ability, they are encouraged to submit those scores. If a student does not feel that the SAT or ACT scores accurately reflect academic performance and/or ability, the student should not submit them.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			Will Saint Michael’s accept the ACT (American College Test)?
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			For students wishing to include testing scores in their admission application evaluation, we will accept the ACT or the SAT.
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	h3			Does Saint Michael’s require students to submit their SAT/ACT scores on an ‘official score report?’
https://www.smcvt.edu/admission-aid/apply/admission-process	p			If you choose to submit test scores, we prefer to receive the official score report although we do not require it. If it is your high school’s policy to include test scores on the transcript, we will still be able to receive scores you choose to submit through the school with the SAT/ACT.
