http://www.usfsp.edu	h3			Student Begins Political Journey by Shadowing St. Petersburg City Councilwoman
http://www.usfsp.edu	p		a	During the Fall 2019 semester, 
http://www.usfsp.edu	a			30 first year students paired with mentors
http://www.usfsp.edu	p		a	 from St. Petersburg organizations and businesses as part of a new 
http://www.usfsp.edu	a			Innovation Scholars Career Exploration Program
http://www.usfsp.edu	p			 at USF St. Petersburg.
http://www.usfsp.edu	p			One of these students was Johnette Williams, a political science major who entered USF St. Petersburg last semester from Seminole, FL. For students with varied interest, the career shadowing program may help them hone their interests, but Williams already knew her interests lay in public service and holding public office. That was clear from her application, and the coordinators of the Innovation Scholars program immediately saw a fit with St. Petersburg City Councilwoman Gina Driscoll.
