https://www.phoenix.edu	span			Is University of Phoenix an accredited university?
https://www.phoenix.edu	p		a	University of Phoenix is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (
https://www.phoenix.edu	a			http://hlcommission.org
https://www.phoenix.edu	p			). Since 1978, University of Phoenix has been continually accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and its predecessor. University of Phoenix obtained its most recent 10-year Reaffirmation of Accreditation in 2012–13.

https://www.phoenix.edu	a		i	Degree Programs 
https://www.phoenix.edu	span			What resources are available to help me develop a financial plan to pay for my education?
https://www.phoenix.edu	p		br	Once you’ve chosen your degree program and decided whether you will attend online or at a local campus, you can determine how much you’ll invest in your education and how you will pay for it. We can walk you step-by-step through the process with the tuition and expenses estimating tool, Financial Plan and Net Price Calculator.
https://www.phoenix.edu	p			 With the financial planning tool you can:
https://www.phoenix.edu	li			Determine your estimated tuition and expenses based on your degree program and location.
https://www.phoenix.edu	li			Enter your financial information to explore ways to pay for your tuition and expenses.
https://www.phoenix.edu	li		br	Review your financial plan to see if you need to make adjustments.
https://www.phoenix.edu	p			Having information about your taxes, savings and any prior college credits available will help with this process. The more specific the information you provide, the more accurate your estimate will be.

https://www.phoenix.edu	a		i	Financial Options 
https://www.phoenix.edu	span			How long will it take to complete my degree?
https://www.phoenix.edu	p			Completion time depends on the program you choose and the number of transfer credits applied to the program. Speak with an Enrollment Representative to get detailed information.
https://www.phoenix.edu	span			How do I attend a class online?
https://www.phoenix.edu	p			Attending online class is easy, all you need is a reliable internet connection.
