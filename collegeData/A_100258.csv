http://www.capital.edu/admission	h2			What Sets Capital University Apart?
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p			Every university gives reasons why it’s the right one for you. Of course, you know — and we know — that no university is right for everyone. But if you’re looking for a place where you’ll be heard, where you can discover your potential, and explore what you want from life, Capital University is the ideal place to launch the rocket that is you.
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p		a	Since first opening our doors almost two centuries ago, we have welcomed thousands of students to our campus. Here, you’ll find a university where 
http://www.capital.edu/admission	a			your professors
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p		a	 know you by name, where personal attention and guidance are yours for the asking, and where classes are small and the 
http://www.capital.edu/admission	a			facilities and resources first-rate
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p		a	. You’ll also find a social scene fueled by concerts, events, varsity and intramural sports, the friendly and accessible 
http://www.capital.edu/admission	a			neighborhood of Bexley and the excitement of Columbus
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p			 — one of the most prosperous, livable, and exciting cities in America.
http://www.capital.edu/admission	h3			Take the next step and get the facts you're looking for.
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p		a	No matter where you are in your educational journey — preparing to graduate high school, transferring from another school, or resuming your education at any level — spend some time on our site, 
http://www.capital.edu/admission	a			check out our majors and minors
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p		a	, and 
http://www.capital.edu/admission	a			available financial aid
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p		a	. Then 
http://www.capital.edu/admission	a			plan a visit to our campus
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p			 and see if the Capital has what you’re looking for to move your life forward. Take the first step by telling us where you are now and what you’re looking for:

http://www.capital.edu/admission	b			Any attempt to describe CapFam falls short.
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p			 The beauty of Capital is in our people and the bonds we share. Our campuses in Bexley and downtown Columbus put us at the heart of Ohio's capital city and connects our students with the fastest growing city in the Midwest – and the opportunities within. Living on campus is the best way to immerse yourself in the Capital experience. If you’ve only seen our campus through photos on our website or direct mail, don’t underestimate the impact of a brick-and-mortar visit. It's the best way to experience CapFam for yourself.

http://www.capital.edu/admission	b			Be part of something bigger than yourself without losing yourself.
http://www.capital.edu/admission	p			 At Capital, you'll find meaningful ways to use your gifts. We believe education should prepare you for purpose in work and life. And because learning happens everywhere — in class, in the community, in a student organization, in the lab, or on the field — your learning and impact begin immediately. All of these experiences work together to shape who you are, what you know, and what you will do in the world.
