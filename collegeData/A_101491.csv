http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	h1			Is Early Decision Right for You?
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			Skidmore's Early Decision plans are designed for those students who have examined                                     their college choices carefully and have decided, by November 15 or January 15 of                                     their senior year, that Skidmore is their first-choice college. Regular Decision applicants                                     can also convert to Early Decision until February 1. The following questions and answers                                     should be helpful to you in deciding whether Early Decision is right for you. We encourage                                     you to discuss your plans with your parents and guidance counselor before making a                                     final decision.

http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	a	h4		Early Decision Checklist
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	strong			How many Skidmore students enroll through Early Decision?
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			Though it varies from year to year, nearly 50 percent of the most recent entering                            class, the Class of 2022, enrolled through Early Decision.                         
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	strong			How do I apply as an Early Decision candidate?
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p		a	To submit an Early Decision application, students should file the Application for                            First-Year Admission with the application fee (or request for a fee waiver) by November                            15 for Round I and by January 15 for Round II. Candidates should check the box on                            page one of the application indicating that they are applying for Early Decision and                            submit the signed Early Decision Agreement Form with the application (the Early Decision                            Agreement Form can be found on the 
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	a			Common Application website
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			.) Regular Decision applicants can also convert to Early Decision until February 1.                         
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p		a	Since the Admissions Committee renders decisions on Early Decision applications within                            a month of the deadline, it is very important that the required information from the                            counselor and teachers be submitted in a timely fashion. 
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	a			See our Early Decision Checklist for more information about requirements and deadlines.
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	strong			When will I receive a decision on my application?
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			Students who apply by the November 15 deadline for Round I will be notified of the                            decision on their application in mid-December. Those who apply by the January 15 Round                            II deadline will hear by February 15, as will those who convert Regular Decision applications                            to Early Decision by February 1. While Early Decision candidates may initiate applications                            to other colleges, if they are accepted under one of the Early Decision plans they                            must immediately withdraw all other applications and enroll at Skidmore.                         
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	strong			How do I apply for financial aid as an Early Decision applicant?
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			Candidates who are applicants for financial aid should register online for the College                            Scholarship Service (CSS) Financial Aid Application as soon as possible. (CSS PROFILE                            registration guides are available in high school guidance offices.) A CSS PROFILE                            customized financial aid application for Skidmore will be made available from the                            College Scholarship Service and should be completed online as soon as the applicant                            knows they are applying Early Decision to Skidmore.                         
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	strong			 If I am accepted Early Decision and am an applicant for financial aid, when will                               I hear about my financial aid package?
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			Accepted students whose financial aid applications are complete will receive notification                            about their financial aid with their decision letters. Accepted Early Decision candidates                            whose financial aid files are incomplete are notified as soon as they submit the missing                            financial aid information.                         
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	strong			What is the difference between the Round I and Round II Early Decision plans?
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			The only difference is the dates. Many students visit colleges early and know by November                            15 that Skidmore is their first choice and are able to file a Round I Early Decision                            application. Other students wait until January 15 because their decision to apply                            early came after the Round I deadline or because they want the Admissions Committee                            to have the benefit of new test scores and/or senior grades through the first semester                            in making the decision on their application.                         
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	strong			What if I apply for Early Decision and am not accepted?
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			Most students who are not accepted Early Decision are deferred for reconsideration                            in the spring and notified of their final decision in late March. The Admissions Committee                            defers students in order to have the benefit of additional senior grades and/or test                            scores that may not be available at the time of early decision or to see how they                            compare competitively to the entire regular decision applicant pool.                         
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			In some cases, it is apparent to the Admissions Committee that an Early Decision candidate                            will clearly not be competitive for admission and that it is in the student's best                            interest to know this sooner rather than later. In this situation, the Admissions                            Committee denies the applicant at the time of early decision notification, thus enabling                            the student to focus on alternative plans.                         
http://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/apply/early.php	p			Good luck in your college search!
