http://www.lpts.edu/give	h2			Why Give
http://www.lpts.edu/give	b			When you give to Louisville Seminary, you Engage the World
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h3	h2	br	With every gift there is a story, a reason, a calling.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h3	h2	br	Maybe it is to help students receive scholarship support. Maybe it is to get faculty the tools they need to provide the best theological education. Maybe it is gratitude for the faith leaders who have touched your life. Maybe it is a way to say thanks for your own Seminary Experience â enhanced by a scholarship, guidance from a faculty member or a life-changing field education opportunity.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h3	h2		Whatever the reason, your gift makes a difference.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h3			Giving: Myths VS. Facts
http://www.lpts.edu/give	b			Myth #1
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	Since the Seminary provides 100% tuition scholarships to masterâs level students, it must have all the money it needs.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	b	br		FACT
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	While Louisville Seminary is blessed with an endowment, it supports only a portion of the tuition scholarships for our students. Nearly XX% of scholarship dollars awarded each year are possible because of gifts from donors like you. When you give to Louisville Seminary, you are directly supporting future faith leaders and helping them avoid crippling student debt in their life of ministry.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	b	br		Myth #2
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	I can only give a small amount, and that won't make a difference.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	In Fiscal Year 2018-19, around XX donors gave $100 or less to the Seminary, resulting in more than $XXXXX raised. Helping to make Louisville Seminary better for the future is a collaborative effort. Gifts of all sizes make a difference.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	b	br		Myth #3
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	The Seminary doesn't need me âalums and churches support it.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3		Because we are a specialized institution, we have approximately 2,400 living alums throughout the U.S. and the globe. We are proud that our alums represent the largest group of donors to the Seminary, but their financial resources are generally more limited as they are devoted to a life of service and ministry. Many congregations continue to support the Seminary, but those numbers and dollars have diminished over the years. We depend on you to support our students and our mission.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h3	h4		Donor Recognition
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	All that Louisville Seminary is today has been made possible by the devotion and faith-filled support of those who have come before us. We honor that generosity through the Presidentâs Circle, Seminary Sustainers and Caldwell Society, all of which have been established to recognize the generosity of the Seminaryâs alums and friends.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	b	br		Presidentâs Circle
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	This annual giving society celebrates the leadership of donors who contribute $1,000 or more each year. These gift provide a strong foundation to support our tuition scholarships, educational instruction, field education, library resources and chapel ministry. Members of the Presidentâs Circle empower Louisville Seminary to accept the divine invitation, the challenges, and the reward to build bridges and engage the world.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	Presidentâs Circle members receive invitations to special Seminary events. Their leadership is an important example to others considering meaningful financial commitments to Louisville Seminary.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	Gifts of $1,000 can provide...
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	â¢ A scholarship for a current student.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	â¢ The opportunity for a student to pursue a research project in his or her area of interest.

http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	Frank H. Caldwell served as President of the Seminary for 28 years, as well as six years as Professor of Homiletics before becoming President. He directed the PCUS Foundation, led the effort to reunite the northern and southern churches from the 1930s to the 1950s, and influenced the lives of hundreds of Louisville Seminary students before his death in 1987.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	Fannie W. Caldwell was well known and loved on campus for her genuine caring and hospitality. She was known for never forgetting a face or a name, an ability that greatly contributed to the Seminaryâs ministry over the years. She died in 2008.

http://www.lpts.edu/give	i			The Donor Bill of Rights was created by the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the Giving Institute: Leading Consultants to Non-Profits. It has been endorsed by numerous organizations.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	b	br		The Donor Bill of Rights
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To assure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the not-for-profit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	I. To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	II. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	III. To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	IV. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	V. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	VI. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	VII. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	VIII. To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	IX. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.
http://www.lpts.edu/give	h4	h3	br	X. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	h2		December 6, 2019
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	div		A religious scholar who explained how one of Christianityâs earliest creeds still applies to contemporary life has earned the 2020 Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	a			Stephen J. Patterson
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	p	a	, a professor of religious and ethical studies at Willamette University, won the award for ideas he set forth in 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	a			âThe Forgotten Creed: Christianityâs Original Struggle against Bigotry, Racism and Sexism.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	p		 Oxford University Press published the book in 2018.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	p		In his work, Patterson explores the significance of a baptismal creed adapted in a letter by the apostle Paul to the Galatians in the New Testament (3:26 and 28): âFor you are all children of God in the Spirit; there is no Jew or Greek; there is no slave or free; there is no male and female, for you are all one in the Spirit.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	p		Christâs first followers were dealing with race, class and gender issues, slavery and conflicts between Greeks and Jews in an environment not too far removed from the one we live in today, he says.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	p		âHistory reminds us again and again that it has always been easier to believe in miracles, in virgin births and atoning deaths, in resurrected bodies and heavenly journeys home,â Patterson says, âthan something so simple and basic as human solidarity.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	p		Patterson has written nine books and more than 75 articles related to the origins of Christianity. He also lectures on the hidden histories of early Christianity and has appeared in several documentaries.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	p		âPattersonâs well-written book proposes a fascinating way to think about those earliest followers of Jesus and their radical notions of human solidarity,â said Tyler Mayfield, Faculty Director of the Grawemeyer Award in Religion and the A.B. Rhodes Professor of Old Testament at Louisville Seminary.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	p		The University of Louisville and Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary jointly give the religion prize.

This is the first honorary doctoral degree given by Louisville Seminary in its 165-year history. According to Seminary President Rev. Dr. Alton B. Pollard III, Wilmoreâs service and contributions to the church, theological education, and humanity warrant the recognition.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âDr. Gayraud Wilmore is one of the most consequential faith and thought leaders of recent generations,â said Pollard. âA magnificent clergy-activist in the spirit of Henry McNeil Turner, Ida B.

Wilmore was an assistant professor of social ethics at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, taught social ethics at Boston University School of Theology, taught black church studies at Colgate Rochester Divinity School, served as the dean of the divinity program at New York Theological Seminary, and as a teacher of church history at the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âWe must live Godâs justice, not just sing and pray about it,â said Mumford of her Baccalaureate sermonâs theme. âIt is easy to become so focused on what our society tells us are the signs or outcomes of righteousness and godliness, that we lose track of what biblical prophets like Amos have told us are ways of being that are most important to God. These ways of being include doing justice, which, among other things, means that those who have power must use it for the benefit of all and not just for the chosen few. But power begets comfort and the desire to preserve our power, which often leads us to erect boundaries between ourselves and those with whom we are called to enact justice.â

http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	h2		Mar 01, 2019
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	Like many of you I have walked, watched, and prayed with many friends in the United Methodist Church in recent days and through the years. This weekâs special Session of the General Conference has brought enmity, brokenness, and fragmentation to many lives â in particular to those in the LGBTQIA community and also to households of faith seeking to do justice and love mercy. Across our manifold denominational and religious lives we have yet to enter into the fullness of who we are as beings, created in the image of the divine, and yet one promise is sure. 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			It is a sacred truth: We, all of us, are the children of God. We are the body beloved. We are the rainbow community. We are the universe displayed. We belong to one another. We are family.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	Two hundred and forty-three years after the founding of this nation our struggle as a citizenry to embrace the promise of equality, equity, civility, comity, truth, justice, and inclusiveness evident in our body politic also continues. However haltingly, falteringly, or stumblingly â religion, region, language, politics, ethnicity, ability, race, gender, generation, and class â distinguishing markers often used to foment division are incredibly becoming the very intersectional means to change we seek, as we expand the meaning of our democracy and accord to every citizen the dignity of difference as persons and in community. 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			It is a sacred truth: We the people. A more perfect union.  E. Pluribus Unum. Yearning to breathe free. We belong to one another. We are family.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	Our movement toward and for and with one another especially and exquisitely includes the efflorescence of human love. We embrace our LGBTQIA kith and kin with a full and embodied love precisely because of love. In our personal and societal lives everyone deserves the right to tranquility, fulfillment, advocacy, security, love and life. Transgender, queer, bisexual, lesbian, gay, questioning, intersex, asexual, or allied, we are in this life together. Louisville Seminary, let us love our sisters and brothers, companions and friends, with a love that will not let each other go. May we model our theological education. 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			It is a sacred truth: Love is unconditional. Love is our fierce responsibility. Love always finds a way. We are Ubuntu. We belong to one another. We are family.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	h2		Feb 21, 2019
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	How does religion influence American politics and culture? For most of Americaâs history, white Protestantism, has been a dominant cultural force, but a combination of demographic change and an abandonment of churches by younger generations may bring this era to an end.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	a			Public Religion Research Institute CEO
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	 Dr. Robert P. Jones will deliver his Grawemeyer Lecture âWhy Religion is at the Heart of Americaâs Identity Crisisâ in Caldwell Chapel at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary (1044 Alta Vista Road, Louisville, KY 40205). The lecture, which is free and open to the public, begins at 7 p.m.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	a	Jones won the 2019 Grawemeyer Award in Religion for his book, 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			The End of White Christian America
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	 (Simon & Schuster, 2016), which offers insight into the meaning of faith and the proper place of faith in defining our civic values at a time when evangelical Christianity seems to have become a political rather than a spiritual movement.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	How does Jones explain the election results of 2016 with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress and the White House?
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âThe 2016 election results are better understood as the death rattle of white Christian America, said Jones, who is also a columnist for The Atlantic. âDown the home stretch of the 2016 presidential campaign, one of Donald Trumpâs most consistent talking points was a claim that Americaâs changing demographics and culture had brought the country to a precipice. He repeatedly cast himself as the âlast chanceâ for Republicans and conservative white Christians to step back from the cliff, to preserve their power and way of life.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, jointly with the University of Louisville, awards the $100,000 prize to honor and publicize creative and significant insights into the relationship between human beings and the divine. The award also recognizes ways in which this relationship may inspire or empower human beings to attain wholeness, integrity, or meaning, either individually or in community.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âJonesâ book well explains the decline of mainline Protestantism that many of us see in our churches and theological institutions,â said Tyler Mayfield, Faculty Director of the Grawemeyer Award in Religion and A.B. Rhodes Associate Professor of Old Testament at Louisville Seminary. He offers appropriate critique of the ways in which mainline Protestants have been a public voice for racial justice yet have failed to address systemic racism, and he outlines the shift in the discourse of evangelicals from dominance to âreligious libertyâ.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	In addition to his work with Public Religion Research Institute, Jones serves as the co-chair of the national steering committee for the Religion and Politics Section at the American Academy of Religion and is a past member of the editorial boards for the Journal of the American Academy of Religion and Politics and Religion, a journal of the American Political Science Association. He holds a doctorate in religion from Emory University, a Master of Divinity degree from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, and a Bachelor of Science degree in computing science and mathematics from Mississippi College.

What issues must ministers and congregants address to effectively provide spiritual, social, and personal guidance to the rural communities they serve?

http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âThe majority of churches in America are in rural communities,â said Cowser. âMinistry in rural spaces is understudied and under-resourced. We want to build relationships with rural clergy, learn from them, and provide resources that will enrich their ministries and communities.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	African American ministers, statewide moderators, lay leaders and seminary students who are either currently serving or who will be serving in a rural context are encouraged to attend.

According to Jelks, for them, liberation was not simply defined by material or legal well-being, but by a spiritual search for community and personal wholeness.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	h2		Dec 07, 2018
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	White Protestantism has dominated U.S. politics and culture for much of the nationâs history, but demographic change and an exodus from churches by the young are bringing the era to a close.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	a	That prediction comes from Robert P. Jones, founder and chief executive officer of 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	a			Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI)
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	a	, who has won the 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	a			2019 Grawemeyer Award in Religion
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	a	 for his book, 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	. Simon & Schuster published the work in 2016.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	University of Louisville and Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary jointly give the religion prize.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	America is no longer mostly white and Christian, Jones found. Although 54 percent of the U.S. population met that description in 2008, the number fell to 45 percent in 2016. The election two years ago gave Republicans political control of the country but also signaled a âdeath rattleâ for white Christian America, he said.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Jones also explained an affinity between white evangelical Protestants and President Donald Trump in his book, noting Trump âcast himself as the last chance for Republicans and conservative white Christians to step back from the cliff, to preserve their power and way of life.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	White Protestants, particularly white evangelicals, must find their place in a new America or face challenging internal and external consequences, he warned.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âJones well describes the decline of mainstream Protestantism many of us are seeing in our churches and theological institutions,â said Tyler Mayfield, an associate professor of Old Testament at the seminary who directs the religion award. âHe also offers an appropriate critique of how mainline Protestants have failed to address racism even though they have been a public voice for racial justice.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	PRRI is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that conducts independent research at the intersection of religion, culture and public policy. In 2016, The 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			New York Times Review of Books

http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	On Tuesday, November 13, about 200 people gathered to celebrate the grand opening of Independence Bank in Louisville, Kentucky. Located in St. Matthews Square, just down the road from Louisville Seminary, the bank's architectural design was intended to maintain a sense of history celebrated by the St. Matthews community.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	h2		Oct 30, 2018
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em	br		Editor's note: Louisville Seminary President Alton B. Pollard III issued the following statement regarding the recent hate crimes committed in our community and throughout the country.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	My Friends in Faith:
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	My Friends in Community:
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	These past several days have proven to be a true test of our humanity. Vile hatred has reached epidemic proportions.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	On Wednesday, Metro Louisville experienced white supremacy in its most lethal form and the loss of two Black lives. What sense is there to the violence of shooting human beings in a grocery store based on the color of their skin? 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	The Jewish community of Pittsburgh experienced the travail and devastation of anti-Semitic hate on Saturday. What sense is there to the violence of entering a house of worship and taking the lives of others based on their religious beliefs? 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Package bombs were mailed to political and business representatives across the country. What sense is there to the violence of sending package bombs to those with different political views?
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	"Our community - our country - has experienced this three-tiered trident of hatred over the past seven days. This is not humanity's mandate from God. This is not how we build the ""City of God."""
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Racism, anti-Semitism, and political xenophobia are unacceptable in any context, especially when these expressions of hatred accrue human collateral damage - when God's greatest gift, the gift of life itself, is violated, stolen, destroyed just because someone looks, thinks, or believes differently.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Where is God in the midst of all this terror? Where is the comfort of God in the throes of such disregard for humanity? This past Friday, Professor Scott Williamson delivered a powerful and relevant sermon in Louisville Seminary's Caldwell Chapel. It was a sermon that challenged us to seek and understand God's presence in our hearts in the midst of our own failures.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	What do we do with that awareness? Do we really understand what God calls us to do?
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	It's concerning that there are those in our society who believe that violence is a righteous testament of faith. Indeed, it is sad when lack of compassion, disregard for human life, and, frankly, a complete misinterpretation of sacred texts from across all faith traditions leads us down the path of self-destruction. 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Black, brown and white, Jewish, Muslim and Christian, transgender and gay, and more - the Louisville Seminary community stands with all communities under siege in this very present hour. Hatred will not have the last word. Our better angels will prevail.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	This is our declaration.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	This is our vow.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	This is our action.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	This is our faith.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	We are all in this struggle together.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	h2			Louisville Seminary creates new Division of Student Engagement
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	h2		Sep 28, 2018
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	The âLouisville Seminary Experienceâ embodies much more than a studentâs matriculation toward a life of ministry and service. Itâs an experience that calls on students, as well as faculty, staff and alums, to live their lives according to the seminaryâs mission of building bridges and embracing the world in great need.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	In that spirit, Seminary President Alton B. Pollard III recently announced a restructuring of services offered to seminary students and alums. Effective October 8, Kilen Gray, Louisville Seminaryâs Dean of Student Engagement, will lead the new Division of Student Engagement. The offices of admissions, alum relations, and financial aid will report to Gray as part of the new division.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âStudent matriculation is about more than books, papers and classes,â said Gray (MDiv â02, DMin â16). âThe ministry of Louisville Seminary is about both the world coming to our campus and our campus finding its place in the world. This new division will give alums the opportunity to become more involved in the life of the seminary â from student recruitment to community and church relations. Students will also have a more cohesive body of resources at their disposal and will be able to draw not only from the wisdom of our faculty and staff, but also from those who have been in their shoes.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Sandra Moon (MDiv/JD â11), who has served as the seminaryâs Director of Alum, Church and Community Engagement since 2015, will serve as Interim Director of Admissions and Alum Engagement. Financial Aid Coordinator April Stepney and Admissions Specialist Becky Young complete the Student Engagement departmental staff.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Gray (MDiv â02, DMin â16) will be part of the seminaryâs senior administration along with Pollard; Pat Cecil, Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Cook, Interim Seminary Dean; Sally Pendleton (MDiv/MAMFT â97), Vice President of Institutional Advancement; and Edwin Aponte, Executive Director of the Louisville Institute.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âAs before, our colleagues will continue to closely interface with Academic Affairs and other departments,â said Pollard. âInternally, their work will reflect a more cohesive unit. âI am excited about what together our student-centric efforts will accomplish on behalf of our students and Louisville Seminary!â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p		As the seminary transitions to a new student service structure, many thanks go to Emily Miller (MDiv '09) for her faithful service to Louisville Seminary as Director of Recruitment and Admissions. Miller's final day of service to Louisville Seminary will be October 16. Her decision to leave Louisville Seminary stems from her desire to be closer to her home in Berea, Kentucky, where her husband, Jake (a 2007 Louisville Seminary alum), recently accepted a job as Chaplain at Berea College.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	h2			Sue Garrett Resigns Post as Seminary Dean; Steve Cook to Serve as Acting Dean
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	h2		Sep 11, 2018
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	On August 31, 2018, Dr. Susan R. Garrett concluded six years as Dean of Louisville Seminary. She will spend a year on sabbatical and then return to full-time teaching in the fall of 2019.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	a	Among her accomplishments as Dean, Sue oversaw the recruitment, hiring, and professional development of a number of new faculty and staff members. She authored several successful grant proposals, including ones to the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations (to support 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	), the Henry Luce Foundation (to support Doors to Dialogue), and the Association of Theological Schools (to support programming in restorative justice). She led the faculty in designing new program-assessment measures and practices, as well as a new curriculum. And, together with administrative and faculty colleagues, she continually tended to student needs and worked to help students thrive.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âServing as Dean has been quite challenging but also profoundly rewarding,â Sue said. âThe joys of the office were chiefly in the strong collegial relationships I was able to develop with our gifted faculty, administrators, and support staff, who work so hard to advance the learning of our students and overall mission of our school. I leave the office eager to spend more time teaching and writing, but I am sad to step away from the engaging work to which I have had the privilege of devoting myself these past six years.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Sueâs plans for sabbatical are to design a book series on the Bible and the culture wars and write the first volume in it, write a grant proposal for faculty development focused on inclusive pedagogy, and continue her role as chair of the Seminaryâs self-study committee for reaccreditation with the Association of Theological Schools.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âDr. Garrett is and always will be an integral part of our seminaryâs faculty and our seminary community,â said Seminary President Alton Pollard III. âHer commitment to the quality of education here and her enthusiasm for our seminaryâs mission are exemplary. Her deanship may mark the end of an era, but we can still celebrate the many influential and meaningful gifts that Sue shares with Louisville Seminary. My thanks to her for her service.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Dr. Steve Cook, the Registrar and Associate Dean for Institutional Research and Effectiveness, has assumed the role of Acting Dean.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p		âI canât thank Dr. Cook enough for his willingness to fill this vital role,â added Pollard. âI know he will maintain an outstanding level of efficient and effective professionalism in the office.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	h2			A Message of Thanksgiving from Alton B. Pollard III
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	h2		Sep 04, 2018
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Dear Louisville Seminary Community:
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	I write these words from a heart overflowing with love, joy and thanksgiving for you. In the weeks and months since my appointment as President-elect of this signature institution, I have been showered with well-wishes and prayers that have carried me forward to this present moment. Today, I proudly serve as the tenth President of Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and carry within me the gift and gravitas of what that responsibility means. I am surrounded by the company of the faithful here at Louisville Seminary. My work will be held in sacred trust. Every one of you - from the children and families who reside on our campus and the men and women who maintain our facilities and staff our offices to the members of our alumni association and more - together will ensure that we do not grow weary in well-doing. My time with you will be extraordinary because of who you are and what you desire for us to be. I have been called to one of the most prominent seminaries in theological education, and after 165 years we have only just begun. I continue to marvel at this blessing. I have been invited to become one of you, to take up this presidential work, for such a time as this.  
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	My first month at Louisville Seminary has been time well spent meeting and learning from staff and administrators. With our academic year now officially underway, I will continue to do more of the same, engaging our students and faculty to the best of my ability. As a creature of finitude, I am in some ways bound by the constraints of time and space. My best intentions notwithstanding, my energy and memory will falter at times. I will make mistakes. I will err. I will fall short. Without fail, I will seek to be an effective leader, strive for excellence, and practice self-love and communal care. I will necessarily be away from campus for extended periods of time, summoned to the wider work of the presidency, but I will not be inaccessible. I will be raising our institution's profile, sharing our good news, engaging our alums, expanding our circle of friends, raising funds, cultivating generosity, extending hospitality, bearing witness, and being our public face. I will return to campus and to ongoing and meaningful engagement with our students, faculty and friends.  
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	My leadership style is principled, inclusive and consensus-seeking. When and where a declarative word needs to be given, quietly and confidently, I will provide the same. I will wear my business suits as appropriate and my beloved African attire most of all. I will represent our mission of Louisville Seminary to our stakeholders and the general public with a dedication and commitment that begins here at home in Louisville and Kentucky. I will worship with local congregations and proclaim the Good News when and where called upon. I will seek out our city's communities of color and foster our engagement with diverse peoples and faiths. As a seminal seminary of the PC(USA), we are building bridges of understanding with a transformative faith that actively engages the world. We covenant to model our exemplary mission in instruction and delivery, worship and practice, governance and advising. By inheritance, we are many lamps, one light, a seminary proudly born of the Presbyterian and Reformed traditions, courageously living into our ecumenical, interfaith and intersectional possibilities. In a world sorely distressed, God's people everywhere have need of us. A reconciling justice companions our history. Our just dedications powerfully honor the same today. 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	"I am particularly excited to work closely with Louisville Seminary's Board of Trustees chaired by our alum, the Rev. Lant B. Davis. They are deeply dedicated to our institutional flourishing. I look forward to meeting the President's Roundtable and the considerable gifts each member brings to our community. Already, I have begun to meet our alums and will be reaching out to our base of graduates and friends seeking their support. I am grateful for our student body and its dynamic leadership. I am proud of the academic reputation and public witness of our illustrious faculty. I am honored to join the collegium of scholars here at Louisville Seminary from faculty and students to administrators and staff. Most of all, I am excited for what we will accomplish together. There will be some difficult days ahead. We will engage in strategic and systemic change for the betterment of our institution. As President, my pledge is to regularly communicate and keep you well informed. I will share with you the promises and challenges that face Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and theological education writ large. I will solicit your prayers as we put our trust in God: ""Great is thy faithfulness!"""

http://www.lpts.edu/news	h2			An Independence Day Message from President Jinkins
http://www.lpts.edu/news	p	h2		Jul 03, 2018
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Like many people I know, I made a decision to avoid watching or listening to the news this summer. A confirmed newsaholic, this was a big decision for me. But I thought it might just make me feel better. I didnât think my voice mattered much or that my vote did either, so why shouldnât I retreat into the cocoon of mystery novels and the process of relocation?
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	a	Last week, however, and I donât really know why, I picked up 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	a			Edmund Burke
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	 and read him again. Burke was the brilliant, iconoclastic genius behind British conservatism. I mean, incidentally, real conservatism, not the angry, anti-intellectual, highly reactionary, misogynistic, nativist and often racist movement that has stolen the name these days, but the conservatism that at the height of the Enlightenment helped establish many of the democratic ideals that continue to undergird the institutions of our day.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	An Anglo-Irish politician of the eighteenth century, Burke was the original voice behind a freedom-loving, justice-seeking political movement that committed itself to conserving that which is best in human society, not just the assertion of individual rights, but the primacy of the common good. Burkeâs greatest literary work was his study of the French Revolution; he is well-remembered for his debates in print with Thomas Paine. But most people remember him today for a few extraordinary quotes.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	George Santayana, the nineteenth-century Harvard professor, often gets the credit for one of these, but it was actually Burke who first said: 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			âThose who donât remember history are destined to repeat it.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	Burke also said: 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			âThe only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good [people] to do nothing.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	And it was Burke who said: 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			âNobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	I suspect that there was some providence in my turning to Burke last week, because as hard as you try, unless you move to a secluded off-the-grid cabin on the backside of a mountain, you are going to get at least a smattering of news. And I realized, as I saw children separated from parents and locked in cages, and I read the comments that equate the arrival of refugees and immigrants with an âinvasion,â that my feeling of political impotence is no excuse for not speaking up. And a few days ago as I learned of a three-year-old being separated from her grandmother (who is her legal guardian), I asked myself what I would do if I were in that grandmotherâs shoes. What would I do if I had rescued one of my grandchildren from a despotic regime in Central America and made my way toward the border that boasts those famed Stars and Stripes that promise freedom and justice for all, only to be treated as a criminal just for seeking asylum? And what would I do if Grace or Clara or Anderson was torn from my arms in the name of that country to which I had fled for safety?
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	To unplug from the news and to tune out from what is going on in our country is an act of cowardice on my part. Certainly, if Iâve learned anything from Thomas Merton and William Stringfellow, Dorothy Day and Thich Nhat Hanh, Isaiah, Amos, and Jesus of Nazareth (not to mention Jesusâ mother!), it is that there is such a thing as a spirituality of politics, an engaged spirituality, a faith that speaks and acts not out of anger, but out of compassion, that does not seek to divide and conquer, but seeks to make whole that which is broken. And what is broken today lies at the heart of our country and our world. It didnât get broken overnight. It took decades to get this way.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Somehow we have allowed the least compassionate voices to prevail. Somehow we have allowed the most self-centered, angry, greedy, and uninformed voices to prevail. Somehow we have allowed our common life to become more accommodating of office-seekers, careerists, and power-mongers than of servant-leaders. Perhaps we justified this to ourselves as members of political parties with some sort of âends justify the meansâ mishmash of âRealpolitik,â but the terrible disease of factionalism that always infects political parties has grown now to the point where we can no longer ignore it as people of faith, no-faith, or as citizens.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	I do not want to see the world lose the shining hope that resides in the idea that is America at her very best. America is and always has been an idea more than a place or a particular group of people. America stands for freedom, not just of the strong, not just of the dominant, but of all. America stands for the idea that no one is above the law and everyone deserves justice and a fair shot at a good life. At our best, we have stood for the ideas for which America is recognized and about which we love to boast. But that is what is threatened today â along with the lives of many of the poorest and most vulnerable people among us.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	America deserves better than we Americans are standing for today. And make no mistake about this, the evils being committed are being committed in our name as Americans. History will hold us all accountable. And so, at the risk of redundancy, I will remind us of Edmund Burke again:
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em		br	âThose who donât remember history are destined to repeat it.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em		br	âThe only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good [people] to do nothing.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	God bless you. And especially this week I pray that God will bless America, but I also hope we will seek to keep the promises made in the name of America for the sake of the whole world.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Last Thursday, Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary announced the appointment of the Rev. Dr. Alton B. Pollard III as its tenth president. Pollard spent the morning with seminary trustees who formally voted on his appointment. Throughout the afternoon, Pollard met with seminary faculty, students and staff and participated in a welcome service at Louisville Seminaryâs Caldwell Chapel.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Louisville Seminaryâs Presidential Search Committee, which was comprised of seminary faculty, students, trustees, senior administrators and alums, were especially impressed by Pollardâs ecumenical background.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	In accordance with the seminaryâs by-laws, Pollard will transfer his membership to a Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) congregation in Louisville. Pollard was ordained by an independent Baptist congregation and is presently a member at Covenant Baptist United Church of Christ in Washington, D.C. He has previously served as associate minister at Trinity Tabernacle Baptist Church in Marietta, Georgia, and at Emmanuel Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He has also pastored A.M.E. churches in Tennessee and Baptist churches in Massachusetts and North Carolina. In addition, he was supply minister at Mt. Pisgah Presbyterian Church in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âDr. Pollard will bring all of the gifts from his diverse ecumenical background with him to our seminary,â said Mary Gene Boteler, a Louisville seminary alum and trustee who served on the Presidential Search Committee. âHe is excited about walking this next season with a people called âPresbyterian.â Those of us who have spent time with him are grateful to God for this spirit-led calling of Dr. Pollard to Louisville Seminary.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Rev. Emily Miller, a Louisville Seminary alum and the seminaryâs director of recruitment and admissions added: âPresbyterian theology, to me, is inherently ecumenical. Our current and future students have a lot to be excited about with Dr. Pollard as our new president.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Next week, Pollard will attend the 223rd General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), which will take place in St. Louis, Missouri. There, he will meet with the leadership of the Committee on Theological Education as well as PCUSA leadership. Louisville Seminary will also host a reception and a luncheon at General Assembly, where Pollard will have more opportunities to meet seminary and church constituencies.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âAs Louisville Seminaryâs president, I will build upon the seminaryâs historic tradition and current momentum, imparting the story and advancing a trajectory for innovation consistent with the institutional ethos âto cultivate relationships inside and beyond the seminaryâ and fulfilling the vision of âbuilding bridgesâ in a complex interreligious society and world,â said Pollard, who serves on the Board of Directors for In Trust Center for Theological Schools and the Advisory Committee for the Luce Fund for Theological Education.

http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Current Seminary President Rev. Dr. Michael Jinkins announced his retirement in April 2017. Pollard will begin work as president at the start of the fall semester this September and will be formally inaugurated in spring 2019.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Pollardâs appointment follows a national search conducted by a presidential search committee including several Seminary trustees, faculty members, and other seminary constituents and led by Board Chair Lant B. Davis of Birmingham, Alabama.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âDr. Pollard embodies Louisville Seminaryâs long tradition of bridging differences within the church and broader society,â said Davis. âHe will affirm and further develop our historic Presbyterian emphasis on inter-denominational cooperation. Under his leadership I hope the Seminary will demonstrate a way forward through some of the most divisive issues of our time. He is a principled peacemaker.â
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Jinkins will continue to serve as president until September 2. During his eight-year tenure, Louisville Seminary launched its bold Covenant for the Future vision which made full-tuition scholarships available for every masterâs degree student and, by 2021, will provide stipends for living expenses. The only seminary in the country to offer this benefit, Louisville Seminary students participating in the scholarship âpay the debt forwardâ by engaging in learning and service opportunities that enhance their opportunities for leadership in church and non-profit sectors.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Other highlights of Jinkinsâ leadership include the growth of the Seminaryâs Marriage and Family Therapy program, one of only four seminary-based accredited programs in the nation, and the Doors to Dialogue program that prepares students to lead in a world of growing religious differences and needs including immigrant communities, urban centers, intolerance and environmental preservation.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	âDr. Pollard's reputation as an eminent scholar and renowned leader precedes him,â said Jinkins. âI believe he is precisely the leader Louisville Seminary needs for the next chapter in its history. And I feel honored to welcome him as the next president of the Seminary.â

http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	As part of the ceremony, the Devoted Service Award, which recognizes individuals for their dedicated service in the life of the Church, was presented to the Rev. Michael Lindvall (pictured). Lindvall is the senior minister emeritus at Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City. Devoted Service Awards were also given to Leonard Jordan, moderator of the Synod of Living Waters, and Steven Merrin, moderator of the Synod of Mid-America.
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	"Lindvall also served as the commencement speaker. His commencement address, ""Professional?"", reminded graduates of the risky but necessary need to deeply love those who they are called to serve."
http://www.lpts.edu/news	a	br		"WATCH ""PROFESSIONAL?"" DELIVERED BY MICHAEL LINDVALL."
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	Lindvall is the author of numerous essays published in both periodicals and books. He has written two novels: 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			The Good News from North Haven
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	 (Doubleday, Pocket, Crossroads), which made the 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			New York Times

http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			Leaving North Haven
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	 (Crossroads). He is also the author of three volumes of accessible theology: 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			A Geography of God
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	em	 (Westminster-John Knox), 
http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			What Did Jesus Do: A Crash Course in His Life and Times

http://www.lpts.edu/news	em			Knowing Godâs Triune Story
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	 (Witherspoon).
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	"Prior to Commencement, Louisville Seminary's Baccalaureate worship service was held in Caldwell Chapel at Louisville Seminary. Scott C. Williamson, Louisville Seminaryâs Robert H. Walkup Professor of Theological Ethics, delivered the Baccalaureate sermon, ""The Journey to a New Season"", and referenced scripture from Ecclesiastes 3:1-8."
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Each year, members of the graduating class select the Baccalaureate preacher and create a worship service. Williamson (pictured) joined Louisville Seminaryâs faculty in 1997 to teach theological ethics. Williamsonâs research on the moral thought of Frederick Douglass was published by Mercer University Press (2001), and his research on resistance ethics was published as a chapter in Resistance and Theological Ethics, by Rowman & Littlefield Publishers (2004). Williamson has also published for the church. Notably, he contributed to Preaching Godâs Transforming Justice: A Lectionary Commentary, published by Westminster John Knox Press (2011).
http://www.lpts.edu/news	div	p	br	Louisville Seminaryâs Black Church Studies Program is Williamsonâs great joy. He was one of three professors who first discussed the possibility of a BCS program at Louisville Seminary, and, in the years that followed, he championed the cause and shared in the hard work of building a strong program. The BCS program is now a signature feature of the Louisville Seminary curriculum.
