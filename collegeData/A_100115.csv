At Baker, our enrollment representatives know your financial aid award and your pet’s name. Our deans know your career goals and breakfast order. It’s different here. Baker University builds achievers, doers, and global citizens, ready to tackle the world. Our students can say it best:
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			MICHAELA | History & Communication Double Major, Class of 2017
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	p			“Everything fell into place when I became involved at Baker—I found my niche. I know everyone says it, but it’s so true that there really is a place for everyone here. I love everything I do because I get to influence people’s experience at Baker and help them love it as much as I have learned to. I get to see the direct results of my hard work and see how it affects the students around me.”
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			EDDIE | Class of 1989
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	div	h2	br	“Often being a good leader is less about knowing the work and more about knowing your people. The breadth of the Baker experience provided me opportunities to learn the important life skills to become a successful leader at work and at home.”
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	div	h2		 —Associate Manager, Engineering Project Management & Integration Office, NASA
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			KATIE | Sociology Major, Class of 2011
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	div	h2		“Nine years ago, I had my own campus visit. Since then, I joined a sorority, lived in a castle, skied for the first time, met some of my best friends, have been a bridesmaid in three college friends’ weddings, saw the original site of the chapel, won a national dance championship, graduated with honors, went to law school, traveled to 12 countries, ran a half marathon, became an attorney, and advised and taught students at the place where it all began.”
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			PATTI | Class of 1988
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	div	h2	br	“For me, my experience as a female student–athlete had the most impact on my growth as a leader. I learned and honed my communication and collaboration skills and truly understood what it takes to be gritty and resilient and to get back up after setbacks. I also learned not only how to win and lose, but also how to win and lose in public.”
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	div	h2		 —CEO, National Association of Collegiate Women Athletics Administrators
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			JIM | Mass Media Major, Class of 2017
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	div	h2		“The biggest advantage Baker has given me with broadcasting is the ability to actually do it. I know several people that go to bigger schools with ‘better’ journalism programs, but they don’t get to actually practice. I’ve been able to broadcast games, host radio shows, and gain tons of experience since the day I walked on campus. There aren’t many places anywhere else in the area where that is possible.”
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			JESSE | Communications Major & Theatre Minor, Class of 2016
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	div	h2		“I chose theatre as my minor because I love doing theatre and it’s this creative outlet that keeps me mentally healthy. And studying at Baker, I was able to take a lot of courses outside of theatre and had so many more opportunities here than I would have gotten at a large school.”
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			DANTE | Music Education Major, Class of 2017
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	p		span	“When I first visited, everyone on campus would say 
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	span			hi to me and it was so friendly. It was the community that brought me here, and that includes the music faculty. They really do a lot to try and prepare you for life after graduation because they generally care so much about every student. They work hard to make me the best musician I can be.”
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			AMANDA | Business & Accounting Double Major, Class of 2018
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	p		span	“What I love most about Baker are the small class sizes 
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	span		br	and how, no matter what, I can always approach my professors. And also how easy it is to get involved but still be able to be academically pushed. Baker is definitely where I’m supposed to be.”
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			LUKE | Class of 2017
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	p			“Someday, I’ll tell my children about how Baker has given me the world and a place I will always call home. Baker is 158 years old, and here’s to 158 more years worth of lives changed and memories made.”
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	h2			MEGAN | Business & Economics Double Major, Class of 2016
http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	p			“My favorite part of Baker is the relationships formed here. I can hold a conversation with just about anyone I see on campus, even if I’ve only met them once. The professors genuinely care about me as a person and continue to show that long after the classes I took from them are over. This is especially true of my adviser, as I often sit in his office for an hour at a time, discussing things not even remotely related to Baker or my studies.”

http://www.bakeru.edu/admissions	p			Baker University School of Nursing offers both bachelor’s and master’s programs. Our nurses, nursing educators, and nursing administrators are compassionate, dedicated, and confident professionals who have a tremendous impact on the communities in which they serve. Baker builds its nurses at its partner hospital, Stormont Vail Health, in Topeka, Kansas. Although it’s not mandatory, Baker’s School of Nursing encourages prospective students to take their prerequisite courses at the College of Arts and Sciences in Baldwin City—that way, students can enjoy two years of the traditional residential campus experience. Our online Master of Science in Nursing program offers two tracks—nursing education and nursing administration—to prepare graduates to shape the next generation of health care professionals.

http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	h2			Official High School Transcript
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	p			Request your high school send a final official transcript directly to us:
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	em		br	Office of Admissions, Baker University
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	em		br	 P.O. Box 65
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	em			 Baldwin City, KS 66006
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	p			Currently enrolled high school students may submit a six- or seven-semester transcript for application purposes. A final transcript, bearing date of graduation, eight semesters of grades, and the signature of a school official must be submitted upon graduation. If available, class rank should also be included on the transcript.
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	h2			Official College Transcript

http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	h5			What Is an Official Transcript?
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	p		span	Some institutions use electronic transcript services (e.g., National Student Clearing House, eScript, Parchment) to transmit transcripts electronically. Baker University accepts these as official if they are transmitted appropriately by either choosing Baker University as the recipient in the drop-down box or by placing 
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	p			 as the recipient email address.
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	p			Official transcripts that are not sent directly from the school (i.e., goes to the student, the parents, coach, or other representative of the student who then sends it on to Baker) cannot be used to transfer credit or for financial aid purposes.

http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	p			Scores sent directly from the testing agency or those included on high school transcripts are accepted for review. When taking your test be sure to include Baker University’s test code:
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	li			ACT code – 1386
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	li			SAT code – 6031
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	h2			Notification
http://www.bakeru.edu/apply-bc	p			All admission decisions are made on a rolling basis, with notifications usually being sent two weeks after the receipt of all required documents.
