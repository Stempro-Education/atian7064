We pride ourselves on building relationships and responding to                      the needs of our professional students.

http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	span			Graduate school admissions to Lake Forest’s MBA program are determined in part by                            a candidate’s commitment to the ideals of leadership, communication, contribution,                            and motivation.

http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	a			Contribution
http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	a			Motivation
http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	h2			Leadership Potential and Professional Experience
http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	p			Our students demonstrate leadership potential right from the beginning of the program.                               We consider both professional experience and past achievements when assessing applications.                               While we recommend four years of professional experience, the quality of accomplishments,                               clear career growth and goals are even more significant. We are looking for self-confident                               individuals who actively seek opportunities to improve themselves.                            
http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	h2			Verbal and Written Communication Skills
http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	p			Effective communication is a vital skill for business leaders. Our students are thoughtful                               listeners who consider colleagues’ perspectives and clearly articulate their ideas,                               whether verbally or in writing. Successful Lake Forest MBA applicants display the                               ability to confidently interact with peers and supervisors. They communicate fluently                               on a wide range of subjects in a professional business context.                            
http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	h2			Ability to Contribute to the Lake Forest Experience
http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	p			A substantial part of the Lake Forest Graduate School of Management experience is                               shaped by interaction with classmates and faculty. Our candidates actively participate                               in classroom discussions, work collaboratively outside of class, and expand their                               professional relationships with colleagues. During the graduate school admissions                               process we identify career-oriented applicants eager to share their professional experiences,                               work in teams, and apply new business skills.                            
http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	h2			Intellectual Ability and Motivation
http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions	p			Lake Forest Graduate School of Management students are ready to expand their minds                               and their careers. In addition to a bachelor’s degree or equivalent, accepted students                               display a desire to grow professionally and personally. They demonstrate an established                               knowledge base that allows them to make connections between class assignments and                               work experience. Our versatile students master analytical and quantitative concepts                               while employing their innate good judgment to make prudent business decisions.

http://www.lakeforestmba.edu/admissions/financial-aid	p			Companies often provide financial assistance to employees pursuing education to advance                            their careers.
