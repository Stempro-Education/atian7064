That's because there is no single thing that make students want to go to Northern; it is ALL the things that we do here.  Northern is big enough to offer a wide variety of academic programs but is also small enough that every time you walk across campus, you'll probably wave ""hi"" to someone you know.         "

At Northern Michigan University, natural curiosity and intellectual challenge meet in stimulating classes grounded in the liberal arts. So wherever your curiosity leads you, you can count on the support you need to take the next step, ask the next question, propose the next hypothesis.         
http://www.nmu.edu	div			                               Marquette, home of Northern Michigan University, was ranked as one of the safest college towns in America, according to The SafeWise Report. Northern takes pride in having a campus that is caring, inclusive and ready to take action in light of safety concerns. Northern encourages students, employees and visitors to make themselves familiar with the resources and services available for assistance in matters of safety.

There's a student organization or club – almost 300 at last count-- for just about every interest. If you're into investigating the paranormal, anime or improv comedy, there's a group. Cheer on your fellow Wildcats at a hockey game or volleyball match. Join a competitive club sport or an intramural team.  The sky is the limit.

That's because there is no single thing that make students want to go to Northern; it is ALL the things that we do here.  Northern is big enough to offer a wide variety of academic programs but is also small enough that every time you walk across campus, you'll probably wave ""hi"" to someone you know.         "

There's a student organization or club – almost 300 at last count-- for just about every interest. If you're into investigating the paranormal, anime or improv comedy, there's a group. Cheer on your fellow Wildcats at a hockey game or volleyball match. Join a competitive club sport or an intramural team.  The sky is the limit.

That's because there is no single thing that make students want to go to Northern; it is ALL the things that we do here.  Northern is big enough to offer a wide variety of academic programs but is also small enough that every time you walk across campus, you'll probably wave ""hi"" to someone you know.         "

At Northern Michigan University, natural curiosity and intellectual challenge meet in stimulating classes grounded in the liberal arts. So wherever your curiosity leads you, you can count on the support you need to take the next step, ask the next question, propose the next hypothesis.

There's a student organization or club – almost 300 at last count-- for just about every interest. If you're into investigating the paranormal, anime or improv comedy, there's a group. Cheer on your fellow Wildcats at a hockey game or volleyball match. Join a competitive club sport or an intramural team.  The sky is the limit.

That's because there is no single thing that make students want to go to Northern; it is ALL the things that we do here.  Northern is big enough to offer a wide variety of academic programs but is also small enough that every time you walk across campus, you'll probably wave ""hi"" to someone you know.         "

http://www.nmu.edu/admissions/applyto	div			          Curiosity is the raw ingredient of knowledge. It causes us to ask questions, to seek answers, to learn. At Northern Michigan University, natural curiosity and intellectual challenge meet in stimulating classes grounded in the liberal arts. So wherever your curiosity leads you, you can count on the support you need to take the next step, ask the next question, propose the next hypothesis.         
http://www.nmu.edu/admissions/applyto	div			                               Marquette, home of Northern Michigan University, was ranked as one of the safest college towns in America, according to The SafeWise Report.

Northern encourages students, employees and visitors to make themselves familiar with the resources and services available for assistance in matters of safety.

There's a student organization or club – almost 300 at last count-- for just about every interest. If you're into investigating the paranormal, anime or improv comedy, there's a group. Cheer on your fellow Wildcats at a hockey game or volleyball match. Join a competitive club sport or an intramural team.  The sky is the limit.

That's because there is no single thing that make students want to go to Northern; it is ALL the things that we do here.  Northern is big enough to offer a wide variety of academic programs but is also small enough that every time you walk across campus, you'll probably wave ""hi"" to someone you know.         "

At Northern Michigan University, natural curiosity and intellectual challenge meet in stimulating classes grounded in the liberal arts. So wherever your curiosity leads you, you can count on the support you need to take the next step, ask the next question, propose the next hypothesis.         
http://www.nmu.edu/apply	div			                               Marquette, home of Northern Michigan University, was ranked as one of the safest college towns in America, according to The SafeWise Report. Northern takes pride in having a campus that is caring, inclusive and ready to take action in light of safety concerns. Northern encourages students, employees and visitors to make themselves familiar with the resources and services available for assistance in matters of safety.

There's a student organization or club – almost 300 at last count-- for just about every interest. If you're into investigating the paranormal, anime or improv comedy, there's a group. Cheer on your fellow Wildcats at a hockey game or volleyball match. Join a competitive club sport or an intramural team.  The sky is the limit.
