https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	h2			First-Year Application Process
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	em	br		Where do I start?
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p		a	You can use the 
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	a			Common Application
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p		a	 or the 
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	a			Berry Application
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			, both of which are free and both of which are treated equally in the application process.
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			Both applications ask you to write an essay. Our advice: instead of trying to impress us with your accomplishments (the rest of your application does that), use your essay as a chance to show us who you are, how you think and what you value. Your academic record tells us what kind of student you are. Your essay tells us what kind of person we’d be inviting to join our community.
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			In addition to your application and essay, we also ask that you submit the following:
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	li			High School Transcript(s)
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	li		ul	SAT and/or ACT results (we will accept a PDF of your score report) 
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	li			Berry’s SAT Code: 5059
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	li			Berry’s ACT Code: 0798
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			The following items are not required (but are more than welcome):

https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	strong			Early Action (EA):
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			 This option lets you hear our admission decision before the end of the fall semester and ensures that you are considered for the full range of Berry’s scholarships. Early Action admission offers are non-binding, which means you can be admitted and still choose to go elsewhere (though this would be illogical, in our opinion).
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p		a	If you plan to apply for aid, we highly, highly, highly (repetition deliberate and heartfelt) recommend that you submit the 
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	a			FAFSA
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			 by November 1 so that we have as much time as possible to help you figure out how to make a Berry education affordable for your family.
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	strong			Regular Decision (RD):
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p		a	 Still need some time to figure out where you want to apply? Or maybe you’d like us to consider your first semester grades before we make an admission decision? No problem. Just like the other decision rounds, we (strongly) encourage you to submit your 
https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			 by the application deadline to receive full consideration for scholarships and financial aid.

https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			Waiting is one of life’s less pleasant occupations. Please know that while you’re sitting mournfully by the mailbox, we’re reviewing your application, reading your essay, taking our time to get to know you and imagining you as a member of this community.

https://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			While you wait, keep busy, keep working hard, do good in your community (these are the things that Berry students do every day).

http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h2			Why Berry?
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	It's an important question. (Answers below.)
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3			We're just the right size (in our utterly unbiased opinion).
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	At 2,100 students, the Berry community is big enough that you'll be constantly meeting new people but small enough that you'll be known and supported and heard.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3		em	We'll get you ready — for anything. And 
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	em			everything
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	No matter your personal path or career destination (or whether you're undecided on either or both), each of our 42 majors and 38 minors equips you with knowledge, skills and habits of mind that prepare you for success in grad school or your first, second or seventh job after college. Berry’s programs in pre-med, pre-law and pre-veterinary science result in pleasingly high professional school acceptance rates.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3			We have a clear plan that makes sure you get the best of the Berry education.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	It’s called the Berry Compact, and its principles of exchange and student ownership go back to our founding. We ask that you pitch in, share your ideas and use your learning for good. In return, we offer a top-flight education, extraordinary mentorship and professional development experiences that make your résumé sing and skills that turn heads at the interview.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3			You will be challenged—and supported.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	Our coursework is rigorous. Our standards are high. But you’ll be free to take intellectual risks knowing you’re surrounded by advisors and guides. Our culture of people helping people is felt the moment you arrive on campus, and are paired with a faculty advisor and a student mentor. From professors, staff and peers to coaches and alumni, Berry people will give freely of their wisdom and experience, answering questions and opening doors.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3			You will have guaranteed access to as many as eight semesters of paid professional development experience.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	Berry students help operate the college they call home, filling more than 1,000 jobs in all 180 departments through our signature LifeWorks program. Whether supervising a chemistry lab, overseeing a herd of angus cattle or running an on-campus startup, you will have guaranteed opportunities to log meaningful management experience while building the unshakable work ethic for which our graduates are known (and rewarded).
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3			You will reap the many benefits of learning and life on the world’s biggest campus.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	Berry’s 27,000 acres make it twice the size of the next largest college campus. But the important story is what our students do with all that space—from field research across a variety of ecosystems to running entrepreneurial ventures to every conceivable form of outdoor recreation.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3			We help make this experience affordable.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	Ensuring students from every financial background have access to the Berry education has been a priority since our founding. Through a combination of merit scholarships and need-based financial assistance, Berry helps lower college costs to manageable levels. We’ll also partner with your family in financial planning and offer payment plans to spread Berry costs throughout the year.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3			You’ll be making the best possible investment in yourself.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		em	Consider this: when you leave Berry, you’ll have a powerful degree from a respected college, (up to) four years of professional experience on your resume, a network of mentors who will advise, connect and support you (and who will write extremely persuasive letters of recommendation on your behalf) for the rest of your life, and a collection of skills and perspectives that will set you apart and above when applying to grad school, interviewing for jobs and tackling any other challenge or opportunity in life. 
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	em			This education is worth every penny.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	 Ask our alumni. No really, please go ask them. (But be prepared for an earful.)
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3			You’ll inherit a legacy of success.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p		br	Our graduates do well for themselves. And they do good in the world. Because they have been pushed academically, they are careful and critical thinkers, able to solve complex problems. Because they have learned with their hands, they understand how ideas connect to action. Because they come of age in a community of support and respect, they know who they are. And where they are headed. And why they matter.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	h3			But these are just words.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p			What matters most is the way you feel when you step onto this campus, whether this is a place you’d want to call home for four years. And for the rest of your life.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/default.aspx	p			There’s one best way to figure it out.

http://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	a			Common Application
http://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p		a	 or the 
http://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	a			Berry Application
http://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			, both of which are free and both of which are treated equally in the application process.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			Both applications ask you to write an essay. Our advice: instead of trying to impress us with your accomplishments (the rest of your application does that), use your essay as a chance to show us who you are, how you think and what you value. Your academic record tells us what kind of student you are. Your essay tells us what kind of person we’d be inviting to join our community.
http://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p			In addition to your application and essay, we also ask that you submit the following:

http://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	li		ul	SAT and/or ACT results (we will accept a PDF of your score report)

http://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	li			Berry’s ACT Code: 0798

http://www.berry.edu/admission/how-to-apply/default.aspx	p		a	If you plan to apply for aid, we highly, highly, highly (repetition deliberate and heartfelt) recommend that you submit the
