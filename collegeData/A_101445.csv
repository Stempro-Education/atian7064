https://sfts.edu/admissions-aid/housing	h1			Campus Housing 
https://sfts.edu/admissions-aid/housing	p			Our residential college provides seminary students the best opportunity to learn in an open and engaging environment. Whether you choose a theology major, seek education for healthcare chaplaincy or pursue a Doctor of Ministry degree, our graduate student housing is designed to support your academic success while providing the independence you want.
https://sfts.edu/admissions-aid/housing	p			Full-time San Francisco Theological Seminary students can enjoy subsidized on-campus housing just a short stroll from downtown San Anselmo, a quaint town with cafes, restaurants, shops, and excellent public schools. San Francisco is a 30-minute drive from campus, providing SFTS students with an incredibly rich home away from home while pursuing the call to ministry.
https://sfts.edu/admissions-aid/housing	p			Priorities in the assignment of campus housing, as published in the Student Handbook, are based on the degree program and the number of people in the household, with first priority going to full-time masters students. Housing is primarily for full-time degree program students and eligibility is limited to a certain number of years for each degree program.
https://sfts.edu/admissions-aid/housing	p		a	New students applying to SFTS can obtain housing application forms through the Admissions Office. Please contact Associate Director for Enrollment, Kristin Dableo-Martel for more information 415.451.2825

https://sfts.edu/admissions-aid/housing	div		p	  SFTS requires all adult applicants to Student Housing to complete a criminal background check, in accord with our values and honoring our relationships with each other in community. Applicants who are citizens of the United States or who are currently living In the United States must complete a criminal background check through CertifiedBackground.org.

In addition, all housing applicants, regardless of residency, must submit a true and correct Self-Disclosure Form in which they shall reflect upon and note any prior criminal convictions. The Self -Disclosure Form and criminal background check must be completed at the time of applying for housing. Prior convictions will not necessarily preclude confirmation of student housing.
