http://www.wbu.edu/admissions/how-to-apply.htm	h3			College admissions assistance at Wayland is offered in very much the same way as everything                   else hereâwith a personalized touch!                
http://www.wbu.edu/admissions/how-to-apply.htm	h3		br	The first thing to do is determine at what level and what status you will enter the                   university. While many steps in the application process will be the same regardless,                   variations do exist depending on whether you enter as an undergraduate or a graduate                   student, and if you're coming straight from high school or transferring from another                   college or university. Additionally, while most students enter at degree seeking status,                   others enter as non-degree seeking students.
