https://www.ohio.edu/admissions/apply/dates-deadlines	p			Ohio University operates on two admission cycles: early action and rolling. Early action is a non-binding cycle that gives applicants priority consideration for direct entry to academic programs, merit scholarship programs, and University honors experiences. Applicants who do not meet the early action deadline but who meet the rolling deadline will be considered on a space-available basis. Applications are reviewed and OHIO admission decisions are released on a rolling basis.
