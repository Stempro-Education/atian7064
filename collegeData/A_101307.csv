https://www.admissions.purdue.edu	p			Summer. Fall. Winter. Spring. There's something special about each season at Purdue. When the school year starts in August, our redbrick campus is in full summer bloom -- green trees, bright flowers and cool, wet fountains (perfect for one of our most popular campus traditions - the fountain run). Cool evenings shepherd in fall colors that illuminate our Tree Campus USA community, in the heart of the Wabash River Valley. When snow flies in the winter, there's no limit to the imaginative sliding materials students engineer to sled down Slayter Hill. And when May graduates are ready to accept diplomas, spring blossoms serve as a backdrop for selfies.

U.S. News & World Report ranks Purdue among the most innovative schools in the country and our program to transform large lecture classes into active-learning environments is featured among six ""Classroom Innovators"" in the country by the Chronicle of Higher Education. Through this program, IMPACT, faculty are ditching large lecture classes and creating engaging environments that support discussion and group exercises. Since 2011, nearly 530 courses have been redesigned, and the result? Higher grades and fewer withdraws."

https://www.admissions.purdue.edu	p			In 2018, a years-long project to transform Purdue's front door was completed. The State Street Redevelopment Project reimagined the corridor that begins at the Wabash River and ends at the opposite side of campus. Green space. Bike paths. Gathering places. Outside dining. Broader pedestrian routes.  This project was the result of a historic partnership between the city of West Lafayette and Purdue University -- a collaborative effort that underscores the strong relationship between our college and our college town. Quality of life is a top priority for campus and community leaders who recognize our students will thrive in a town that supports their happiness and success.

https://www.admissions.purdue.edu	p			Do you know how you go to college is just as important as where you go? Purdue partnered with Gallup to better understand what college experiences lead to lifelong success and here are six important experiences we identified: 1. Learning from professors who care about you; 2. Having professors who excite you about learning; 3. Having a mentor who encourages you to pursue your goals; 4. Working on a project that takes a semester or more to complete; 5. Completing a job or internship that allows you to apply what you learned in the classroom; 6. Being active in extracurricular activities.
https://www.admissions.purdue.edu	p			This research is deeply ingrained in Purdue's culture so that these opportunities and experiences are readily available to students in all majors.

The reason this ranking is so meaningful for us? Because we earned it by committing to our priorities – student success and return on investment. 
https://www.admissions.purdue.edu	p			           The formula for this ranking focuses on four key areas: Outcomes – Does the college generate good and appropriate outputs and add value to the students who attend? Resources – Does the college have the capacity to effectively deliver teaching? Engagement – Does the college effectively engage with its students? Environment – Does the college provide a learning environment for all students and make efforts to attract a diverse student body and faculty?
