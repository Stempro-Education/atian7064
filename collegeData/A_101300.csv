http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	a			Application
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h4			 Application
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: What are the academic course requirements to be admitted into Principia? 
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: We recommend a strong college-prep program of 16 solid academic courses in high school, including 4 years of English, 4 years of math (algebra I and II, geometry, plus one additional math course), 3 years of natural science, including some lab work, 2 years of history and social science (including American history), and 2–3 years in the same foreign language as well as 2 years of academic electives (other than music, art, and computer science, unless they are AP courses). 
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: How is my high school grade point average (GPA) computed by Principia College?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: Only solid academic subjects are considered in a re-computation of the high school GPA. These subjects are English, math, history, social science, natural science, and foreign language. All Advanced Placement (AP) courses are considered in the computation of the GPA. AP and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses are given one additional grade point; honors courses are given an additional half grade point. In this way, an A earned in AP English will earn 5.0 grade points rather than a 4.0 (4.5 for an A earned in an honors course). Courses in art, music, speech, drama, health, PE, shop, home economics, computer science, and other elective courses are not considered in the computation of the GPA.
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: How can an admissions counselor help me? 
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p		a	A: Your admissions counselor will support you throughout the college selection and decision-making process. As fellow Christian Scientists first, the counselors are advocates for you, whether or not Principia College is your final choice. Your counselor knows a great deal about the intricacies of the general college search process and is eager to help you make the decision that best fits your talents and dreams. Staying in touch is just a click away: 
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: What is your admissions process? 
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: Once your application is complete (all components have been received by the Office of Admissions), the Admissions Committee will review your application. Close attention is paid to your academic record, your commitment to Christian Science, achievement in extracurricular activities, and your readiness to contribute to the Principia College community. In most cases, you will have a decision within two weeks.
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h4			Financial Aid
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: Does Principia accept payments from 529 Savings Plans?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: Yes, currently Principia College is eligible to accept funds from 529s. Principia’s Title IV code is 001744.
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h4			 Scholarships
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: Will Principia include the score from the writing section of the SAT or the ACT when determining cumulative or composite scores for scholarship eligibility?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: Principia no longer requires the writing section on the SAT or ACT and will not use it in the cumulative score.
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: How does Principia College view AP and IB exams?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: A student who enters Principia with satisfactory scores on AP (3 or higher), IB (4 or higher in higher level examinations), and/or CLEP exams (scores are evaluated according to American Council on Education standards) in subjects that parallel courses given at Principia may receive college credit with approval of the department chairs concerned. No further examination or fee is required.
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: Does Principia offer any athletic scholarships? 
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: As an NCAA Division III school, Principia is not allowed to offer athletic scholarships. 
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q. How do I apply for a scholarship?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A. By completing the general application for admission, you will automatically be considered for scholarships. We begin considering applications and awarding academic and alumni scholarships on a rolling basis.
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: If I am admitted, when do I have to notify Principia of my decision? 
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: While we welcome acceptance notification to Principia College at any time, students begin advising and registration in May, so we encourage you to notify us of your decision as soon as possible.

http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: Can I request a house?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: Not for freshmen housing. Student Life will consider requests from transfer students going into upperclass housing. Assignments are made based on space availability.
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: When will I find out who my roommate is?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: You will find out (and meet) your roommate once you arrive on campus for orientation. You'll change rooms and roommates each semester.
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: When can I make flight reservations to return home after exams?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: Find out when your last final exam is scheduled. Exam times are determined by the hour the course meets during the semester. You may leave campus after your finals are completed.
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: Can I bring my car?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: You can have a vehicle (car, truck, motorcycle, moped, Goped, motorized scooter, or Segway) on campus if you register it with Campus Security. Bring your driver's license, proof of insurance, and $100 registration fee to Campus Security during New Student Orientation. Yearly registration is required for all student vehicles.

http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: Can I wait to purchase housing necessities until after I arrive on campus?

http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	h5			  Q: Can I work on campus?
http://www.principiacollege.edu/admissions/faq	p			A: Yes. Most students work an average of 5–15 hours per week, though some occasionally petition to work 15–20 hours per week. On-campus jobs range from office receptionists and fitness center attendants to sales associates and library assistants. All student employees are required to work 150 hours in our Dining Services or Facilities Departments during their first year at Principia.
