https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	span	span		When is the enrollment deadline?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	div			Once your application has been accepted, you have until April 1 to let us know if you plan to enroll in the fall. Please send your tuition and housing deposits to secure your space for the fall class. We have limited space available for new freshmen and after April 1, we may not be able to accommodate you. Many academic programs at Mount Aloysius College require students to commit at an earlier date – be sure to check your official acceptance letter!     Typically refunds are issued up until May 1, as long as formal notification is received in writing and an extenuating circumstance exists. Housing deposits are not tuition deposits and are non-refundable.  
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	span	span		What materials do I need to apply?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	div		a	Application requirements differ from traditional students to transfer and adult students. Please visit our 
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	a			admissions page
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	div			 to view specific requirements.    All applicants must complete an application and submit a $30 application fee.
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	span	span		How can I apply?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	div			Students can apply for admission either online or with a traditional application. We do not have a preference. However, if students visit campus, we’ll waive the $30 application fee! It is important to apply early during your senior year.
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	span	span		Who is eligible to attend MAC?

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	span	span		What is MAAPP?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions	div		div	MAAPP stands for Mount Aloysius Academic Preparation Program.    MAAPP is a conditional admission program. During the week prior to fall semester classes beginning, MAAPP students participate in a residential program aimed at easing the transition from high school to college, thereby increasing a student’s chance for academic success. MAAPP includes one hour of Educational Enrichment credit. Additionally, students are introduced to campus technology and opportunities to build connections with other students, staff and faculty. Students in the program must complete the program successfully to receive permission to matriculate into the fall semester. During the year students will be full-time students and take some courses together, attend group meetings and will meet their advisors often. Once students are accepted for college matriculation, students work closely with the MAAPP coordinator. Admission into the program is based upon criteria set by the College.

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	div	div		I started college somewhere else. Can I transfer to MAC?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Yes! We love accepting new students from different schools. Over 200 students each fall are actually transfer students.
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Courses that are completed at regionally accredited institutions and are applicable to your major will transfer. We also transfer in credits from selected nationally accredited institutions and the military. Mount Aloysius College has specific articulation agreements with a number of colleges and universities.
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	span			What will it cost to study abroad?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	span	span		2019-10-09T15:37:25-04:00
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	div	div		What will it cost to study abroad?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Depending upon the program, the cost of a semester abroad is approximately equivalent to a semester at Mount Aloysius College. You will continue to pay the regular tuition amount to Mount Aloysius College, not to the university abroad. If you are receiving financial aid, you will need to meet with a member of the Financial Aid Office to  determine what portion of your financial aid you will be able to apply to your study abroad experience.
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Students opting to participate in Study Abroad through CIS-Center for International Studies during the summer, fall or spring semesters should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and may use state, federal and campus-based financial aid (excluding work-study) to defray the cost of the Study Abroad tuition/fees/expenses. The Office of Financial Aid will process your financial aid for these semesters through Mount Aloysius College using your study abroad costs and number of credits that you will be enrolled for in your program. Study Abroad programs may have higher costs than Mount Aloysius College; however, this does not mean that your federal and state awards will be increased (including your Direct Stafford Loan). Contact the Office of Financial Aid for additional funding options if your costs exceed your aid awarded.
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	p			In addition to Mount Aloysius College tuition, the cost of airfare, accommodations, meals, field trips and administrative fees must be factored in. Read the materials from each program carefully to get a reasonably accurate sense of the total cost of the program over and above regular Mount Aloysius tuition. Remember to consider the currency exchange in calculating the cost of your program abroad.

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	div	div		When should I begin my planning for studying abroad?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	p			The key to arranging a successful experience is careful planning. You should begin by meeting with the Registrar’s Office and/or the Faculty Study Abroad Coordinator in the fall of your freshman year but no later than one year in advance of your departure. Although you are not permitted to study abroad for a semester until your junior year, it is not too early to begin planning in the freshman year.

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	div	div		Is there a military obligation associated with ROTC during college?

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	span	span		2019-10-08T20:50:51-04:00
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	div	div		I’m on academic probation. What does that mean?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	p			A Cumulative GPA below 2.0 constitutes a designation of academic probation. The purpose of academic probation is not to warn, rather it is to alert a student that he or she is at risk of not succeeding academically. Once a student is identified as being on Academic Probation, he or she will receive advisement and referral as appropriate. Specific methods of remediation will be prescribed to meet the needs of the individual student.

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	div	div		What if I can’t fit a study abroad semester into my program?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Some undergraduate majors cannot easily include a semester abroad, so you may want to consider other options, such as a summer or intersession study abroad experience. CIS Abroad offers many of these short-term study abroad programs each year.

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	span			 If there is a reduction of income (taxable or non-taxable), unusual medical/dental expenses, elementary and secondary tuition, and dependent care expenses, your family should complete the Special Consideration Forms for both the Federal and State government. These forms are located under the Financial Aid Forms and Documents section of the Mount Aloysius College website.  Special Consideration requests must be submitted by the student and processed by the Financial Aid Office before the last day of the Fall/Spring semester.

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	div	div		I’m a dependent student, but whose information do I report if my parent’s are divorced or separated?
https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	span			You report the information about the parent you lived with for the greater amount of time during the 12 months preceding the date of application. If you didn’t live with either parent, or if you lived with each parent an equal number of days, use information about the parent who provided the greater amount of financial support during that time.

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	span			There are several reasons why you may not receive Federal Work-Study from year to year. The reasons could range from when you filed your FAFSA, how you answered the question on your FAFSA about interest in work-study, to funding levels or even other aid sources you received.

https://www.mtaloy.edu/admissions/faqs	p			MAAPP is a conditional admission program. During the week prior to fall semester classes beginning, MAAPP students participate in a residential program aimed at easing the transition from high school to college, thereby increasing a student’s chance for academic success. MAAPP includes one hour of Educational Enrichment credit. Additionally, students are introduced to campus technology and opportunities to build connections with other students, staff and faculty. Students in the program must complete the program successfully to receive permission to matriculate into the fall semester. During the year students will be full-time students and take some courses together, attend group meetings and will meet their advisors often. Once students are accepted for college matriculation, students work closely with the MAAPP coordinator. Admission into the program is based upon criteria set by the College.
