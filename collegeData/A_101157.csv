https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h2		br	We Are Dedicated To Possibility.
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h2			 Yours.
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	b			You are full of possibility. At Northwest University, we are focused on helping students grow into all that God intends—academically, spiritually, and in their careers. It’s what we’ve done for over 80 years. During that time, we’ve created an academic experience unlike any other. One that will help you discover and unleash all that is possible in your life.
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h2			We Major In Majors
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	p			We offer over 70 majors and programs to get you started on a career path. But that’s not all. Over 70% of NU students are involved in off-campus internships. Here, you’ll learn in class and then put that knowledge to use with local companies. It’s a great way to gain practical experience and set yourself up for a job once you graduate.

https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h2			What will my life look like at Northwest University?
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	a			Career Preparation
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	a			Campus Ministries
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	a			Kirkland & Seattle
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h2			Small Is Smart
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	p			With a student to faculty ratio of 12 to 1, our professors know more than your name—they know you. We take an individual approach to education, rather than the one-size-fits-all at larger schools. And you’ll learn by leading—whether in student government, drama, music, campus ministries, or on mission trips. So, why get lost in a sea of faces? Choose small. Learn large.
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h2			Northwest University
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	p		br	Student to Faculty Ratio:
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	p			 12 to 1
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h2			An Education Built for Eternity
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	p			Research shows that youth are most likely to lose their faith while in college. But NU is not like most other universities. Here, you’ll be encouraged and challenged in your spiritual life like never before. At chapel services. By the new friends you make. By the questions you tackle in class. By the mission trips you experience. And by the image of Christ you see in the students and faculty around you each day.
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h2			What Kind of financial help is available?
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h3			Scholarships
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	p			We offer many scholarships based on merit, talent, or need which do not need to be repaid. See which one is right for you.  
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	h2			We’re In Good Company
https://www.northwestu.edu/admissions	p			Money Magazine voted Kirkland as the 5th best place to live in the US. We’re close to a wealth of recreational activities and companies that have changed the world. For NU students, that means opportunity for fun while you’re here and—more importantly—excellent opportunities for employment once you graduate.
