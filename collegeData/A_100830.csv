http://www.lec.edu	p			"For 160 years, Lake Erie College has been educating students for the world after college. We combine a liberal arts education with practical ""real-life"" experiences."
http://www.lec.edu	p			We promote study abroad, offer opportunities for internships both in the U.S. and internationally and, through our curriculum, we address the needs of students who will work in a world that is increasingly interdependent. Our students learn to communicate effectively, think critically and creatively and make informed decisions. The size of the College allows students to develop leadership skills and take an active role in various student organizations and in the development of new student programs.
http://www.lec.edu	p			"Lake Erie College emphasizes the individual, not the ""masses."" Our classes are taught by professors, not graduate students. Classes are small, allowing students and professors to know one another. We can honestly say that everyone ""will know your name."" Not only will the faculty and majority of the Lake Erie staff recognize you, but we care deeply about the success, development and happiness of our students."
