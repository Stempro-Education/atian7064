https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	h2			Who Comes To Columbia?
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	strong			EACH STUDENT AT COLUMBIA IS A GIFT TO OUR COMMUNITY
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	p			. Columbia students range in age from 20-something to 60-plus. While many are from the southeastern United States, others are drawn from all corners of the world.
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	p			Politically and theologically, they represent a diverse spectrum of viewpoints. Yet, all of our students share one essential characteristic: God has called each one to faithful discipleship and leadership in Christ’s Church.
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	strong			Student backgrounds are represented by a wide array of undergraduate experiences in liberal arts, sciences, mathematics, engineering, and other professional degrees.
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	p			Some students enroll in a basic degree program immediately after college; some after careers in fields such as banking and finance, education, law, marketing and communications, medicine, and visual and performing arts. God uses all of these vocations to provide depth and perspective on our common calling in the world.
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	h2			Why Columbia?
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	p			Columbia Seminary is a great place to receive training for every aspect of ministry. Below are just some of the reasons why students from all over the United States and around the world come to Columbia Theological Seminary.

https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	h4			A Great Place To Live
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	p			CTS is located less than 2 miles from downtown Decatur, GA and less than 6 miles from downtown Atlanta. Our quiet campus is nestled in a residential community on the edge of the city limits of Decatur.
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	h2			World-Class Faculty
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	h4			Excellence in Teaching
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	p			“In teaching church history, I take my students on a journey of self-discovery through deep exploration into the past. As our knowledge of Christian history expands, we better understand how our faith traditions encompass a global story that spans centuries and diverse cultural contexts. We learn how Christians formed the theological doctrines we cherish today, but we also encounter the mistakes Christians made over the course of time. Ultimately, we study the complexities of the past in order to faithfully interpret our present and guide our future as leaders in the church and the world.” – William Yoo, Assistant Professor of American Religious and Cultural History
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	h2			International Opportunities
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions	p		br	“Looking at Christianity from a global perspective humbles me. Christianity is prevalent in the United States: this is a country where Christians can practice and express their faith freely. That is not the case all around the world. I have seen and met people who have been and are being persecuted because of their faith. I can no longer believe that Christian persecution is historical. It is current and it is real. My exposure to Christianity around the world has made me much more of a proponent for a theology of liberation and a seeker of justice for all people. Through my exposure to Christianity around the world with the international programs at Columbia, including a recent trip to India, I now claim the authority to question and challenge oppressive systems outside of my daily context.”

https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	li		ul	Why do I keep reading about Basic and Advanced Degrees? 
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Our degrees fall into one of two categories: Basic and Advanced. Basic Degrees include our MDiv, MAPT, and MA(TS) degrees. Advanced Degrees include our ThM, DMin and DEd Min degrees.
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	li		ul	Can I attend part-time in a degree program? 
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Yes, Columbia Seminary allows students to enroll on a part-time basis in all degree programs. In the MDiv, MAPT, and MA(TS) degree programs, part-time status is when a student is enrolled for less than 9 credit hours in the fall or spring semesters, or 3 credit hours in a summer term.
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	li		ul	What if I want to take one course? 
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	li		strong	Students may apply as special students for the purposes of taking one course. Any credit earned as a special student will be credited toward the degree if the student applies and is later accepted into a degree program. See our 
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	a			Want to Take a Course? page
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	li		ul	How long will it take to complete a basic degree program? 
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Full-time students may complete the MDiv degree in as few as three (3) full years. A student’s program may be lengthened or shortened by a variety of factors, such as participation in internships or taking a reduced load or increased course load in any given semester. The MA(TS) and MAPT programs may be completed in as few as two (2) years. The Dual Degree may be completed in as few as four (4) years.
https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Admissions Questions about Basic Degrees

https://www.ctsnet.edu/admissions/faqs	li		ul	What kind of accreditation is needed by the institution where I earned my bachelor degree?

However, a student who would like to seek admission may apply. In addition to the standard admission application requirements, the student must submit an additional essay. This essay will be assigned during the admissions process.

http://www.ctsnet.edu	a			Cultivating Leaders
http://www.ctsnet.edu	a			Transforming Communities
http://www.ctsnet.edu	p			God is living and active in the world near and far. In academically rigorous classes, we study the work God is already doing, challenging students to imagine what God will do through them and their peers. As an educational institution of the Presbyterian Church (USA), Columbia Seminary is a community of theological inquiry and formation for ministry in the service of the Church of Jesus Christ. 
http://www.ctsnet.edu	p			We are preparing visionary leaders who bring clarity and direction to their ministries, leaders who dwell in the realm of possibility, choosing to enact what can be instead of settling for what is. Internships are one of the many avenues for students to learn and practice their leadership.
http://www.ctsnet.edu	p			We shape and partner with communities in new, profound, and prophetic ways. We boldly proclaim the Gospel and actively seek God's justice in the church and the world. Campus life includes regular worship, fellowship opportunities, and community meals. Beyond the campus, students unite their education with society's most pressing issues.
http://www.ctsnet.edu	h2			thinking  of enrolling at Columbia?
http://www.ctsnet.edu	p			Each student at Columbia Seminary is a gift to the community with his or her own God-given talents. While many are from the southeastern United States, others are drawn from all corners of the world. Politically and theologically, they represent a diverse spectrum of viewpoints. All of our students share one essential characteristic: God has called each one to faithful discipleship and leadership in Christ’s Church.
