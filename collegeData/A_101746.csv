http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			Any incoming first-year students interested in pursuing a major in one of the Arts departments (Music, Theatre & Dance, Visual Arts) may submit an optional portfolio/audition tape.

http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	h4		span	How can I be sure I qualify as a California resident? 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p		a	Living at a California address does not mean you automatically have resident status in terms of tuition. The financial independence requirement makes it extremely difficult for most undergraduate students whose parents are not California residents to qualify for classification as a resident at the University of California. This includes students from community colleges and other post-secondary institutions within California. Transfer students who were classified as residents of California at their previous school should not assume that they will be classified as residents at UC San Diego. See the 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	a			Registrar's Office webpages
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	span	a		 for more information on California residence for fees and tuition.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	h4		span	How should I select a College? 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			Technically, you do not select a College. We do that for you. We ask you to rank your order of College preference on your application so we can keep it in mind during the College assignment process.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	h4		span	Will I get assigned to the first College on my rankings list? 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			We do our best to assign you to a College that matches your rankings but we cannot guarantee you will be assigned to your highest-ranked College. Not to worry, though. Every College at UC San Diego features an exceptional academic program, friendly advisors, unforgettable traditions and state-of-the-art living facilities.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	h4		span	Do specific majors require a specific College selection? 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			Nope! You may major in any subject you wish, no matter which College you are assigned.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	h4		span	Will my College rankings impact my admission? 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			Not at all. We assign students to Colleges after they have been admitted to UC San Diego.

http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	h4		span	I am currently attending another 4 year university. How can I find out if my coursework will transfer? 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			UC San Diego does not have articulation agreements outside of the California Community College system. This means there is no official way to determine which courses will transfer to UC San Diego; however, the general rule of thumb, unofficially, is that if the course(s) was completed at a regionally accredited college or university, and, an equivalent course(s) is offered at the University of California, then the course might transfer to UC San Diego. The only official way to determine UC transferability is to apply for admission.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p		a	Please review the UC San Diego 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	a			Catalog
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			 to determine program requirements by major.

http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			AP grade reports for tests taken in May are sent to the colleges or universities you designated beginning July 15. You can expect actual delivery by July 22. You should have designated the institution to which your grade reports should be sent to on your answer sheets or on subsequent grade report requests.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			Some grade reports take longer to reach us for three main reasons:
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			inconsistent student identification information;
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			late return of exam materials to the AP program; and
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			some students test late using an alternative form of the exam.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			If you requested your exams in May and they qualify for academic credit, the scores and credit will display on TritonLink in the student’s Academic History by July 25.

http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			if you received a BC score of 1 or 2 WITH an AB subgrade of 2 or higher,
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			then you should request from the College Board that your AP Calculus scores be sent to UC San Diego immediately.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	em			(NOTE: AP Calculus AB scores of 1 or BC scores of 1 or 2 WITH an AB subgrade of 1 will not satisfy any prerequisites for math courses.)
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	h4		span	Where can I look to be sure my AP Calculus scores have been sent here? 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			Check your AP Student Grade Report. If the College Code 4836 is listed, then your scores have been sent to the UC San Diego Admissions Office.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p		a	Since your AP calculus scores may not be received and posted before the online enrollment period, you should also send a copy of your AP Student Grade Reports showing your AP Calculus score to the Math Testing and Placement Office (fax 858-534-1011 or email 
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			) as early as possible.
http://admissions.ucsd.edu/faq	p			Include your PID, your desired math placement, and your contact information on the fax or email. Once the Math Testing and Placement Office has received your AP Student Grade Report, they will pre-authorize you to enroll in your desired math course subject to the prerequisite you met and the timely receipt of your fax or email.
