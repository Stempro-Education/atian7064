https://www.menlo.edu	span			Four Menlo College Students Named University Innovation Fellows by Stanford d.school Program
https://www.menlo.edu	span			(Atherton, California/November 18, 2019) The University Innovation Fellows program empowers students to become agents of change at their schools. These student leaders are encouraged to increase campus engagement with innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity and design thinking. Fellows create student innovation spaces, start entrepreneurship organizations, facilitate experiential workshops, work with faculty and administrators to develop new courses, and much more. They serve as advocates for lasting institutional change with academic leaders, lending the much-needed student voice to the conversations about the future of higher education. The program is run by Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school). With the addition of this year’s new Fellows, the program has trained nearly 2,200 students.  Menlo College’s third cohort of fellows is represented by Bianca Barros ‘21, Christopher Overkämping ’21, George Hofstetter ’22 and  Rufus Pappy ‘22. The group has narrowed its priorities for the year to be centered around: enhancing the engagement of off-campus resources, creating more hands-on experiences for students, integrating more interdisciplinary business/socially-relevant general education courses and encouraging a more technologically literate community on campus.  “Higher education needs to change faster to meet the needs of students and industry today,” said Humera Fasihuddin, co-director of the University Innovation Fellows program. “In traditional education systems, students have to wait until they graduate to make a difference. We don’t believe that. As the key stakeholders of higher education, students should be active participants in a change process that helps them learn the skills and mindsets necessary to create the future. The students who participate in our program are ideally poised to help accelerate the pace of change at their schools.”   Contact: pr@menlo.edu...

https://www.menlo.edu	span			Record-Breaking Rise in Menlo College Enrollment
https://www.menlo.edu	span			A record-breaking 35% rise in new students at Menlo College for the fall 2019 semester propelled enrollment to the highest enrollment ever.  The most recent incoming class is a standout for more reasons than the sheer growth it represents: other milestone achievements include an all-time high of 17 students who were the valedictorians of their high schools, a 3.35 overall high school grade point average, 24% minority student representation, and 31% first-generation student representation. Students are attracted to Menlo College from far and wide; they represent 29 states in this country and 38 other countries around the globe.   The record-setting enrollment at Menlo College stands in marked contrast to national trends in higher education. In 2019, national enrollment fell by 1.7%, with the most significant decline reported by the smallest schools. Reflecting strong forward momentum, Menlo College is continuing to see exceptional enrollment growth for the coming semester.  Menlo College’s President Steven A. Weiner said that  “Improvements in recruitment as well as retention contributed to the largest entering class and the largest total enrollment in the 92-year history of Menlo College. We celebrate this unprecedented success in attracting new students to Menlo as a reflection of the attention we garnered last year for the value of our small classes, engaged faculty and staff, and community feel.” He added that “We were helped in getting the word out about Menlo College by the extensive recognition we received for our programs last year. The quality of our education programs were heralded; we received an award from the state for the most innovative internship program; we landed among the top 1% of all schools in the country for the extent of our student diversity; we were ranked #1 in the state for school safety; and we ranked #1 in a study that was conducted to determine the school whose graduates secure the highest-paying jobs in the state.  The fact that Menlo Athletics secured two national titles last year was another well-earned boost to our reputation.”   Dean of Enrollment Management Priscila Casanova de Souza added that “Students and families are increasingly entrusting us with their education, career preparation, and well-being. They invest in a Menlo College degree because it is clear that the entire Menlo community is committed to supporting students in all aspects of their growth.”...

https://www.menlo.edu	span			KANSAS CITY, Mo. – For the 11th consecutive year, Menlo College has been recognized as an NAIA Five-Star Champions of Character Institution, earning gold honors for the 2018-19 season. This marks the third time in the last five seasons Menlo Athletics has earned gold distinction (2014-15, 2016-17). Eight different Golden State Athletics Conference Institutions were named Champions of Character with six earning gold status. Overall, Menlo is among only 25% of NAIA institutions across the country to earn the distinction of gold Five-Star Champions of Character for the 2018-19 season.  Points are awarded through the Champions of Character Scorecard which measures growth in training, promotion, conduct in competition and commitment in five key areas with a possibility of earning 100 points. Institutions can be recognized as Champions of Character Five-Star Institutions at three different levels: Gold (90-100 points), Silver (75-89 points) and Bronze (60-74 points).  This year 180 NAIA institutions earned the Champions of Character Five-Star Institution Award.  The mission of the Champions of Character program is to help student-athletes and their coaches embody five core values: integrity, respect, responsibility, sportsmanship, and servant leadership.  Since the NAIA went to the bronze, silver and gold system, Menlo has three gold awards and three silver awards to its credit....

http://www.menlo.edu	span			Four Menlo College Students Named University Innovation Fellows by Stanford d.school Program
http://www.menlo.edu	span			(Atherton, California/November 18, 2019) The University Innovation Fellows program empowers students to become agents of change at their schools. These student leaders are encouraged to increase campus engagement with innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity and design thinking. Fellows create student innovation spaces, start entrepreneurship organizations, facilitate experiential workshops, work with faculty and administrators to develop new courses, and much more. They serve as advocates for lasting institutional change with academic leaders, lending the much-needed student voice to the conversations about the future of higher education. The program is run by Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school). With the addition of this year’s new Fellows, the program has trained nearly 2,200 students.  Menlo College’s third cohort of fellows is represented by Bianca Barros ‘21, Christopher Overkämping ’21, George Hofstetter ’22 and  Rufus Pappy ‘22. The group has narrowed its priorities for the year to be centered around: enhancing the engagement of off-campus resources, creating more hands-on experiences for students, integrating more interdisciplinary business/socially-relevant general education courses and encouraging a more technologically literate community on campus.  “Higher education needs to change faster to meet the needs of students and industry today,” said Humera Fasihuddin, co-director of the University Innovation Fellows program. “In traditional education systems, students have to wait until they graduate to make a difference. We don’t believe that. As the key stakeholders of higher education, students should be active participants in a change process that helps them learn the skills and mindsets necessary to create the future. The students who participate in our program are ideally poised to help accelerate the pace of change at their schools.”   Contact: pr@menlo.edu...

The Digital Skills Workshop will be hosted by Roberto Martinez, a speaker for the Grow with Google partner program and a Google Digital Coach. Martinez has over 14 years of experience having led over 100 Google digital workshops. He runs his own digital marketing agency and advises various chambers, incubators, and accelerators on scaling companies using digital marketing tools.  All interested parties can RSVP to the event via this link.  About Menlo College  Founded in 1927, Menlo College is a small private four-year college with a mission to ignite potential and educate students to make meaningful contributions in the innovation economy.

http://www.menlo.edu	span			A record-breaking 35% rise in new students at Menlo College for the fall 2019 semester propelled enrollment to the highest enrollment ever.  The most recent incoming class is a standout for more reasons than the sheer growth it represents: other milestone achievements include an all-time high of 17 students who were the valedictorians of their high schools, a 3.35 overall high school grade point average, 24% minority student representation, and 31% first-generation student representation. Students are attracted to Menlo College from far and wide; they represent 29 states in this country and 38 other countries around the globe.   The record-setting enrollment at Menlo College stands in marked contrast to national trends in higher education. In 2019, national enrollment fell by 1.7%, with the most significant decline reported by the smallest schools. Reflecting strong forward momentum, Menlo College is continuing to see exceptional enrollment growth for the coming semester.  Menlo College’s President Steven A. Weiner said that  “Improvements in recruitment as well as retention contributed to the largest entering class and the largest total enrollment in the 92-year history of Menlo College. We celebrate this unprecedented success in attracting new students to Menlo as a reflection of the attention we garnered last year for the value of our small classes, engaged faculty and staff, and community feel.” He added that “We were helped in getting the word out about Menlo College by the extensive recognition we received for our programs last year. The quality of our education programs were heralded; we received an award from the state for the most innovative internship program; we landed among the top 1% of all schools in the country for the extent of our student diversity; we were ranked #1 in the state for school safety; and we ranked #1 in a study that was conducted to determine the school whose graduates secure the highest-paying jobs in the state.  The fact that Menlo Athletics secured two national titles last year was another well-earned boost to our reputation.”   Dean of Enrollment Management Priscila Casanova de Souza added that “Students and families are increasingly entrusting us with their education, career preparation, and well-being. They invest in a Menlo College degree because it is clear that the entire Menlo community is committed to supporting students in all aspects of their growth.”...

http://www.menlo.edu	span			KANSAS CITY, Mo. – For the 11th consecutive year, Menlo College has been recognized as an NAIA Five-Star Champions of Character Institution, earning gold honors for the 2018-19 season. This marks the third time in the last five seasons Menlo Athletics has earned gold distinction (2014-15, 2016-17). Eight different Golden State Athletics Conference Institutions were named Champions of Character with six earning gold status. Overall, Menlo is among only 25% of NAIA institutions across the country to earn the distinction of gold Five-Star Champions of Character for the 2018-19 season.  Points are awarded through the Champions of Character Scorecard which measures growth in training, promotion, conduct in competition and commitment in five key areas with a possibility of earning 100 points. Institutions can be recognized as Champions of Character Five-Star Institutions at three different levels: Gold (90-100 points), Silver (75-89 points) and Bronze (60-74 points).  This year 180 NAIA institutions earned the Champions of Character Five-Star Institution Award.  The mission of the Champions of Character program is to help student-athletes and their coaches embody five core values: integrity, respect, responsibility, sportsmanship, and servant leadership.  Since the NAIA went to the bronze, silver and gold system, Menlo has three gold awards and three silver awards to its credit....
