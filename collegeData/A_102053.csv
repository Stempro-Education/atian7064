https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	a			Transfer Students
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	p		strong	Any student who has 
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	strong			not been enrolled in residential courses for one semester or more
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	p			 is classified as a re-enrollee. Students who intend to re-enroll at Welch College follow a different procedure than do students who are continuously enrolled. Until all the following have been observed, a student will not be officially re-enrolled at the college.
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	span			APPLY NOW
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	strong		span	Complete the 
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	a			Application for Readmission
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	strong			 along with a $15 application fee. The Admissions Committee must approve all readmission applications.
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	li			A re-admit applicant who has attended other institutions since leaving Welch College must have an official academic transcript forwarded from EACH institution. These documents need to be received in the Enrollment Management Office at least 90 days before the semester begins. No readmission will be processed for a student during a term of academic suspension since leaving Welch College or any other school.
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	li		ul	Re-enrollees who wish to return after a suspension, either academic or disciplinary, must meet items 1 and 2, as well as the following: 
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	li			They must completely observe all the terms of the suspension.
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	li			No coursework taken during the term of the suspension will be transferred to Welch College.
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	li		ul	Students must submit for approval a written plan for improvement to: 
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	li			the Registrar, in the event of academic suspension, or
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	li			the Student Dean, in the event of disciplinary suspension
https://welch.edu/admissions/apply/returning-student-application	li			Re-enrollees may be required to meet any changes in the program or curriculum under which they were originally enrolled. (See the requirements of the Catalog under which you re-enroll.)
