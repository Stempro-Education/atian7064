http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply	p			Hello, smart, interesting person.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply	p			You’re here! We’re here! It’s kismet!
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply	p			A few things to keep in mind: First, getting into a college isn’t proof of your excellence—you’re already an excellent human being. Second, this process shouldn't feel like an existential burden; it should feel like an opportunity to remind yourself of who you really are. Third, there’s no fee to apply to Wellesley. Fees are barriers, and we’re all about breaking down barriers.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply	p		a	If a severe weather or a community crisis delays your application, ability to sit for standardized tests, or your school's ability to send required materials, don't panic! Simply let the Admission Office know when we might expect your application materials. Please send us an email at 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply	a			applicant@wellesley.edu
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply	p			 from the same email address you are using for your application.

http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			5 steps toward a painless, possibly joyful application.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			And each step has three substeps. So it’s like 15 tiny steps. Anyway. We offer them based on our own experience, and with total confidence that you will, in the end, blaze your own trail of steps.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	div			                   Some practical advice                  
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	span			Start where you are
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			Before you look at colleges, look (generously!) at yourself.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Ask yourself questions.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 Such as: What courses have I loved? Why did I love them? What motivates me as a student? Is it intellectual engagement? Creative expression? Solving concrete problems? Discovering strange and unexpected things? Challenging convention?
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Keep asking! 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			What motivates me as a human being? What makes me want to get out of bed in the morning? What frustrates me? In what ways do I want to improve? Who’s someone I admire?
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Start asking other people!
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li		a	 Talk to people who know you well: friends and family, teachers and counselors, coaches and mentors. Talk to representatives at 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	a			college fairs
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li		a	. Talk to 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	a			current students
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	a			Talk to us
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li		a	. Or be counter-cultural and 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	a			read viewbooks
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	span			        Show more       
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	span			Get organized
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			A little planning and preparation goes a long way.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Use tools that work for you.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 Make a spreadsheet! Command your calendar to send you reminders! Bookmark your favorite online resources! Adjust your spam filter to accept email from your selected colleges! And so on.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Follow the deadlines.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 Look into required standardized testing and consider the optimal time to take those test(s). Take note of application and financial aid deadlines. Open mail from colleges right away and note schedules for visit programs, information sessions, etc.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	a			Plan a road trip
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li		a	 Try to visit some of the colleges you’re considering. Being on campus, talking to students, feeling the vibe (an actual college admissions term)—these are invaluable. Can’t make it to campus? We’ll do everything we can to give you an immersive 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	a			online experience
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			My advice is to fall in love—a lot. Make sure that every college on your list has at least one thing about it that you’re thrilled about and that motivates you. When you’re fully informed, and when you’re ready to make your final choice, you’ll have options that will make you happy, no matter what you decide.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p		em	Joy St. John, 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	em			dean of admission and financial aid
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	span			Look closer
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			There are more than 5,000 colleges and universities in the United States. You probably shouldn’t apply to all of them.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Make a list of essentials.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 For example: Do you want to be close to a city? Close to home? Do you want a huge university, a small college, or something in between? Are you looking for special programs or majors? (See below for a little counterintuitive advice.) Try to generate a list of 10 to 20 schools that meet your essential qualifications. Then be ready to revise it. 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Question what’s essential.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 For example (this is the advice we mentioned above): Your major is not your life. Most students change majors at some point in their college career. And a major isn’t an ironclad, lifetime commitment. On a related note, ponder the value of a liberal arts education—an opportunity to explore a range of fields, make connections across disciplines, and practice the skills that any income-earning, change-making person needs.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Consider the excellence of women’s colleges.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 We’re just the tiniest bit biased here. And yet, it just so happens that one of the world’s most powerful social and professional networks is made up of our alumnae. Who happen to be women. Not really a coincidence, to be honest.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			My college counselor gave me great advice: ‘College is a match to be made, not a prize to be won.’ The ‘best’ schools are not necessarily the best schools for you. Don’t force a square peg into a round hole. Do what’s right for you, not what you think you’re supposed to do.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p		em	—Adele Watkins ’17, 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	em			Ph.D. candidate in philosophy, Princeton University
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	span			When you’re ready to think about cost, be bold
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			Yes, be bold. Apply to colleges based not on your family income but on your achievements and your aspirations.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Look at the numbers.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 You’ll want to get this information from every college on your list: What percentage of students receive financial aid? What forms of aid are provided? What’s the amount of the average annual aid package? What’s the average loan debt of the most recent entering class?
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Get a rough sense of the true cost.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li		a	 Most selective liberal arts colleges (which may have a higher sticker price) offer financial aid to support families with calculated financial need. The result is that many families pay less (often a great deal less) than the listed price of the college—less even than they would pay at a public or state institution. Every college has a Net Price Calculator on its website—a tool that gives you a rough estimate of what your family would expect to pay. We also have our own 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	a			MyinTuition calculator
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			, a simple, straightforward tool developed by one of our professors.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Pay heed to deadlines!
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 The deadlines for the FAFSA and CSS Profile really matter. A late application can affect your eligibility for financial aid.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			I ended up getting into top-ranked liberal arts schools and large research universities. But in the end, Wellesley was my top choice, and it gave me the most financial aid. If you apply and you get in, they’ll cover 100 percent of your demonstrated need.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p		em	—Aubrey, 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	em			senior, media arts and sciences and political science major
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	span			Write an essay you love
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	p			Which might be different than an essay you think a college will love.  
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Set reasonable expectations.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 You don’t need to have had extraordinary experiences to write an extraordinary essay. You don’t need to have done incomparable things to be interesting. An essay about a small, seemingly insignificant event can be more powerful than an essay about how you’ve saved the world or overcome tragedy. Also: You’re not writing a novel. You should be able to do the work in about 500 words.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Follow a reasonable process.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 Write several drafts; let a draft sit for a few days, then tackle it again. Share drafts with people you trust. Ask them: Does this sound like me? Is it interesting from the start? You know you’re done when you’ve used only the words you need to use to say only what you wanted to say.  
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	strong			Give yourself a pep talk.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/applicationtips	li			 Such as: I love who I am, and no college will change that. I love my voice, and I’m using it now. This is actually fun! I’m having fun! Even if I’m awkwardly telling myself so! I can’t be anyone other than myself, and that’s enough.

http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	h1			How We Make Decisions
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			Here’s a moment of real-ness.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			There’s no typical Wellesley student (we know: every college says that; and yet!), but we tend to be people who know that we don’t know everything; who have a strong voice but listen to other voices; who have big plans but are totally open to changing them; who have taken risks, failed, and figured out a better way.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			We believe in connection. We’re looking for people who are looking for more than a credential—people who are looking for a lifelong community. If that’s you—hi! Yay! Let’s see what’s possible.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	h2			How we make decisions
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			The admission committee at Wellesley College engages in a decision-making process that reflects holistic principles of application review, meaning admission decisions are based on the committee’s consideration of all pieces of an application, quantitative and qualitative, at once and in context of an applicant’s school and home environment. Committee members are trained to assess each student’s academic, co-curricular, and personal accomplishments, as well as her potential to contribute to the Wellesley community. After reviewing applications in their assigned geographic regions, groups of committee members meet to discuss the applicants from their regions. Together the members come to a consensus about the most appropriate admission decision for each student, in the context of the full applicant pool.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			For first-year applicants, Wellesley does not require a fixed plan of secondary school course preparation. However, entering students normally have completed four years of college preparatory studies in secondary school that include training in clear and coherent writing and in interpreting literature; history; training in the principles of mathematics (typically four years); competence in at least one foreign language, ancient or modern (usually four years of study); and experience in at least two laboratory sciences. There are often exceptions to this, and we will consider an applicant whose educational background varies from this description.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	h2			The Board of Admission
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			At Wellesley, admission decisions are made by representatives from the entire community. Since the 1970s, Wellesley has reviewed and admitted applicants using an admission committee, called the Board of Admission, whose members include professional admission counselors, faculty members, current student representatives selected by College Government, and key administrators from the Student Life Division. They are responsible for reviewing and making admission decisions on all applicants to the College.
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			Our goal is to consider each student as a multifaceted and talented person with the potential to contribute to the Wellesley campus in a variety of ways and to admit the best group of students who we believe will enhance the community. 
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	h2			Nondiscrimination
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			Wellesley College admits students of any race, color, national and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national and ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs.

http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			What’s your story?
http://www.wellesley.edu/admission/apply/decisions	p			When I read a student’s application, I ask myself: Who is she? What makes her interesting? Is she curious or adventurous? Does she seek out challenge? Is she willing to take risks? Will she be an active participant in our community? What will she bring to our community? What’s her story?
