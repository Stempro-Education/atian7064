https://www.wileyc.edu	p			The Wiley Cares Campaign is a multi-tiered campaign launched to ensure the holistic success of our students as they matriculate at Wiley College. Affording a college degree is a challenge faced nationwide as well as here at Wiley. We’ve reduced tuition to make a quality education more accessible to all. This reduction beginning in Fall 2020 will make Wiley the most affordable historically black institution in the state. Get more information about the Wiley Cares Campaign and learn how you can be apart of it.

http://www.wileyc.edu	h2			Wiley Cares
http://www.wileyc.edu	p			The Wiley Cares Campaign is a multi-tiered campaign launched to ensure the holistic success of our students as they matriculate at Wiley College. Affording a college degree is a challenge faced nationwide as well as here at Wiley. We’ve reduced tuition to make a quality education more accessible to all. This reduction beginning in Fall 2020 will make Wiley the most affordable historically black institution in the state. Get more information about the Wiley Cares Campaign and learn how you can be apart of it.
