http://future.utsa.edu/apply/#fee	p			What happens after I submit my application?

It can take up to two business days for the application to be received by UTSA once it is submitted. Once the application is received, time needs to be allowed for loading the application into UTSA’s Student Record System.
http://future.utsa.edu/apply/#fee	p			Once the application is successfully loaded into UTSA’s Student Record System and a student record is created at UTSA, an e-mail will be sent from UTSA verifying the receipt of the application and providing the myUTSA ID. The myUTSA ID consists of 3 letters and 3 numbers (example: ABC123). The myUTSA ID and passphrase provide access to the Automated Student Access Program (ASAP). The myUTSA ID must be activated and passphrase created by the applicant before they will be able to access ASAP. For more information on myUTSA ID and passphrase process, visit the myUTSA ID website. If access to ASAP becomes blocked, or non-accessible, contact the One Stop Enrollment Center at 1-210-458-8000 or 800-669-0919.
