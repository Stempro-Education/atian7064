https://www.abac.edu	h3			ABAC Economic Impact Half a Billion Dollars on South Georgia
https://www.abac.edu	p			 TIFTON—Always a major player when it comes to economic impact, Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College hit a home run during the 2018 fiscal year when ABAC impacted South Georgia to the tune of a half billion dollars.    “ABAC’s footprint in South Georgia makes quite a large impression,” Dr. Renata Elad, Dean of ABAC’s Stafford School of Business, said.  “As a result of the overall multiplier effect, ABAC’s economic impact was $499,403,672 in 2018.”    Elad analyzed the overall University System of Georgia (USG) report which was conducted by Dr. Jeffrey M. Humphreys, Director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth in the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business.    “Out-of-state enrollment definitely played a part,” Elad said.  “Obviously, the word is getting around that ABAC offers a valuable education at an affordable cost.”    The USG report covered the 2017 fall term and the spring and summer terms of 2018.  During the 2017 fall semester, ABAC enrolled 3,394 students from 24 countries, 18 states, and 155 of Georgia’s 159 counties.     “With direct student spending of $44,729,654 impacting the region and an overall labor income impact of over $60 million regionally, ABAC is a strong partner in regional growth,” Elad said.  “ABAC has a significant footprint in Tift, Worth, Cook, Colquitt, Irwin, Turner, Decatur, Seminole, Miller, Grady, Early, Thomas, Mitchell, and Baker counties.”     Elad said household spending increased in nine categories in 2018.    “Nationally, nine of the 10 largest components of household spending increased,” Elad said.  “The 7.8 percent rise in personal insurance and pensions expenditures was the largest percentage increase among all major components followed by a 2.5 percent increase in food spending.”    The 26 USG colleges and universities had a $17.7 billion impact on communities across Georgia in 2018, an increase of almost five percent over the previous fiscal year.  The USG also created 168,284 direct and indirect jobs, a nearly three percent increase over the previous fiscal year.    “While we remain focused on graduating more students, keeping college affordable, and increasing our efficiency in delivering a quality education, we are proud our colleges and universities help power Georgia’s economy,” USG Chancellor Steve Wrigley said.  “USG and its 26 institutions play an important role in generating jobs and boosting businesses across the state, befitting the investment Georgia’s leaders have made in us.”    The latest version of the annual study on the USG’s statewide economic impact concluded that, on average, every dollar of initial spending generates an additional 47 cents for the economy of the region that hosts the institution.    Of the USG jobs number, the report found that 30 percent are on campus and 70 percent are off-campus in either the private or public sectors.  On average, for each job created on campus 2.3 off-campus jobs are created as a result.  The jobs generated by the USG account for 3.8 percent of all the nonfarm jobs in Georgia, or about 1 job in 26.                                                                      ###

https://www.abac.edu	h3			Business of ABAC Never Far from Mind of David Bridges
https://www.abac.edu	p			 By Mike Chason    Running a business with a budget of $64 million a year would consume every waking moment of most individuals.  Dr. David Bridges, president of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, is no exception.    “The big difference between running a business and being the president of ABAC is our return on investment is very complicated,” Bridges, the longest serving president of the 26 institutions in the University System of Georgia (USG), said.  “Our return would have to be calculated over the lives and careers of our graduates.”     Dr. David Bridges just began his 14th year as the ABAC President.     Since Bridges became the 10th president in the history of ABAC on July 1, 2006, over 7,000 graduates have received their ABAC diplomas.   Unlike a company that makes only one product and that product eventually rusts away or in the case of food, gets eaten, Bridges hopes that ABAC graduates continue to thrive and build more businesses.    “Students are our business, and our graduates start businesses of their own,” Bridges said.  “During their lives, our graduates generate economic impact in their communities so the ABAC investment continues to grow.”    The latest statewide economic impact study commissioned by the USG showed that ABAC’s economic impact on South Georgia skyrocketed to a record $529,838,507 in fiscal year 2017.  The multiplier effect turned 444 jobs at ABAC into 1,382 jobs off campus for a total impact of 1,826 jobs in South Georgia.    “More jobs at ABAC means more jobs in South Georgia,” Dr. Renata Elad, Dean of the Stafford School of Business at ABAC, said.  “ABAC had a much bigger employment impact plus the cost of housing went up, and the average rent in Tifton went up that year.  Personal expenses for entertainment, apparel, and services were also up.”    Elad analyzed the USG numbers for ABAC and found the ABAC economic impact a monumental 31 per cent higher than the $369,874,664 impact in the 2016 fiscal year.    “ABAC needs South Georgia, and South Georgia needs ABAC,” Elad said in her analysis.  “With total employment of over 1,800 jobs directly from student spending activities and an overall labor impact of almost $66 million, ABAC is definitely a strong partner in regional growth.”    Bridges pointed out that those numbers reflect only South Georgia and the college has changed quite a bit since the study was conducted in 2017.  Bainbridge State College merged with ABAC in 2018, leading to a record enrollment of 4,291 students during the 2018 fall semester.     ABAC attracted students from 30 countries, 18 states, and 155 of Georgia’s 159 counties during the 2018 fall term.  Because of the consolidation, ABAC offered classes in Bainbridge, Blakely, and Donalsonville besides its classes in Tifton and Moultrie.    Many of those students choose to stay at ABAC to complete one of 12 four-year degree programs.   ABAC offered only two-year degrees from 1933 to 2008.  Instead of staying two or three years at ABAC for an associate degree, students remain at ABAC four or five years to complete their bachelor’s degree.      With a bachelor’s degree in hand, graduates have more to offer the world of work.  That expands the ABAC economic impact even further because graduates find higher paying jobs.     ABAC President David Bridges (r) with ABAC Director of Facilities and Land Resources Tim Carpenter (l) look over plans for the Fine Arts building with Jody Buchan from Allstate Construction.     Besides the $64 million annual budget, there’s also the matter of capital investment at ABAC.  Since Bridges’ presidency began, over $84 million in capital projects have been completed or are in the construction phase at ABAC.      Those projects include the Health Sciences building at $7.2 million, ABAC Lakeside at $17 million, Historic Front of Campus at $15.5 million, King Hall at $2.7 million, Donaldson Dining Hall at $4 million, Thrash Wellness Center at $4.5 million, the Laboratory Sciences building at $7.2 million, and the ongoing Carlton Center/Fine Arts Building project at $24 million.  Road improvement adds another $2 million.    “Each of these projects has made this campus better,” Bridges said.  “That plays a part in recruitment of students as well.   When students visit ABAC, they like what they see here.”    Bridges takes advantage of every waking moment to promote ABAC.  His stamina is legendary as is his ability to get things done.  Since his first day on the job, he has been on the move with a wide variety of activities, many of them in the first time ever category.    Bridges’ presidential inauguration at ABAC in 2006 was the first time that ABAC has had an inauguration ceremony.  He kicked a soccer ball into the net to announce the first ever women’s soccer program.  He also pushed a plunger to set off a small charge of dynamite to open the construction on the ABAC Lakeside student housing complex.      ABAC President David Bridges at his inauguration ceremony on Aug. 25, 2006.  It was the first inauguration ceremony for a president in the history of ABAC.     Bridges assisted 103-year-old ABAC alumnus Ethel Arnold Talley when she rang the original ABAC bell at the opening of the Historic Front of Campus project, honored the memory of ABAC alumnus and Medal of Honor recipient Harold Bascom Durham, Jr., at the opening of the Freedom Gallery, and used a cross-cut saw on a log to announce the beginning of ABAC bachelor’s degrees in forestry and wildlife.    With a great sense of pride in his alma mater, Bridges watched fireworks explode over the campus at the conclusion of ABAC’s 100th birthday celebration.  He guided the process when the former Georgia Agrirama became a part of the ABAC campus as the Georgia Museum of Agriculture and Historic Village, headed up the consolidation with Bainbridge State College, and served as Interim Director of Georgia’s first ever Center for Rural Prosperity and Innovation.    “Rural communities have very tangible benefits to offer society as a whole,” Bridges said of Georgia’s Rural Center.   “The Center has a statewide mission and one of the tenets to that mission is to find a path to prosperity for rural communities.”    All these projects took mammoth amounts of time for the ABAC President whose day often begins in the pre-dawn stillness with breakfast at the Northside Café in Tifton.     During the past 13 years, Bridges has enlisted the support of legislators under the Golden Dome for ABAC projects, spoken to civic clubs and community groups far and wide, accepted the award as the Arts Citizen of the Year for Tift County, and received the USG Gold Outstanding Customer Service Leadership Award.     Bridges, who turned 61 in June, points to the establishment of ABAC as a State College as the proudest accomplishment of his tenure.    “That changed everything,” Bridges said.  “Otherwise we would be floundering.  The ability to offer bachelor’s degrees changed ABAC forever.”    Most chief operating officers develop their own management style or try to duplicate the style of other successful leaders of organizations.  Bridges believes his style hasn’t changed much since 2006.    “In some ways, I am a little more patient now than I was when I first became president,” Bridges said.  “In other ways, I think I’m less patient.  General George Patton said, ‘lead, follow, or get out of the way.’  I like that.    “My role is to get people to have a vision of where ABAC needs to go.  Ultimately, most people know the right thing to do.  It’s just a matter of getting them to do it.  Sometimes they need to be nudged a little bit.”    Dealing with the many complexities of the job is often the most difficult part of being the head of a major corporation or in Bridges’ case, a college.    “The biggest challenge is meeting the expectations of people,” Bridges said.  “In our case, that means students, parents of students, faculty, staff, alumni, donors, friends of the college, and the public.  Sometimes people come to the table with totally unrealistic expectations.    “Take students for example.  Some students expect to breeze through college just the way they breezed through high school.  College is different than high school.  Students and parents come to understand that.  Sometimes it takes a while.”    When asked what provides him with the most satisfaction as the ABAC President, Bridges points to two days every year.    “Fall graduation and spring graduation,” Bridges said.  “The graduates have cleared that hurdle.   They have diplomas.  Our expectation is that they will go out and do something with those degrees.”    When he left the tiny town of Parrott in Terrell County in 1976 to attend ABAC, Bridges had no idea he would meet his wife, Kim, in Rosalyn Donaldson’s English class and that one day he would become the only ABAC President who was once a student at the college.       ABAC President David Bridges spends countless hours speaking on his favorite topic, ABAC.     “It was never my dream to become president of ABAC,” Bridges said.  “In fact, I never really thought about it.  Even when I was 40 years old, I hadn’t thought about it.    “I have had opportunities to leave but I always asked myself, ‘is that a better fit for me than ABAC?’” Bridges said.   “ABAC has been a pretty good fit for me.”    Bridges has far surpassed the average tenure of seven years for a college president.  In fact, he is now the second longest serving president in the history of ABAC.  George P. Donaldson was the ABAC president for 14 years from 1947-61.  Bridges has 13 under his belt and is steaming full speed ahead into his 14th year.    “Lucky 13 is over, and now we’ll see what happens in 14,” Bridges said.    Is being president of ABAC in 2019 harder than being president of ABAC was in 2006?    “Oh yes, a lot harder,” Bridges said.  “Now, everybody wants to tell you how to do your business. In 2006, we didn’t have to worry about cyber-security threats.  I didn’t have so many people looking over my shoulder.      “People in our society today tend to be less self-reliant, more contentious, and more self-absorbed.  There seems to be tension about everything, particularly when it comes to political correctness.  People are hyper-sensitive about being offended.  It becomes more pervasive every day.    “It keeps us from focusing on our central mission because we’re dealing with all this other stuff.  My goal is to get something done and make ABAC a better place.”    But one day, there will be a life for Bridges after his ABAC career is completed.    “Sure, that day will come,” Bridges said.  “When it does, I want to continue to be active in the public service sector but in a less prominent way.  I’ll go back to the farm and be a part of something that’s not seven days a week, 24 hours a day.”    Bridges owns the family farm in Terrell County and retreats there as often as possible.  But wherever he goes, ABAC is always on his mind.    “I don’t worry about the day-to-day operation because we have great people to carry on,” Bridges said.  “But it’s always something.  It’s usually an external factor that can cause the wheels to come off fairly quickly.”    Until that retirement day comes, Bridges finds it easy to motivate himself to stay true to the ABAC mission every day.    “We have made great progress,” Bridges said.  “But there’s still a lot to be done.”    ###

https://www.abac.edu	p			" TIFTON/SUWANEE -- An agreement was recently reached which will allow Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College (ABAC) students seeking careers as pharmacists to earn doctoral degrees a year early at PCOM Georgia. The Suwanee campus of Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM) is the home of the College’s PCOM School of Pharmacy.    Dr. Matthew Anderson, Dean of the ABAC School of Arts and Sciences, said, “We are very excited about this new venture with PCOM, which is sure to be of tremendous benefit to our students and the broader region. This agreement will allow students to complete their combined bachelor and doctoral level education in a shorter time frame, which will make this advanced training more accessible and prepare more pharmacists to enter the workforce.""    According to Shawn Spencer, PhD RPh, Dean of the PCOM School of Pharmacy, the agreement will allow eligible ABAC students to enter the pharmacy school after completing their junior year of college.  Students who meet the School of Pharmacy requirements may matriculate into professional school before graduating from ABAC and will have the opportunity to earn a combined BS-PharmD while at PCOM Georgia.    Dr. Spencer explained that after completion of the second year of pharmacy school, these students will be eligible to receive their bachelor’s degree from ABAC having earned the required credits during their first two years at PCOM Georgia. Therefore, students can begin their careers early while saving tuition dollars.      Dr. Spencer said, “We continually strive to add value for our students. We’re very pleased about ABAC’s partnership with us and will continue to support Georgia residents entering the region’s healthcare workforce.”    An articulation agreement similar to the agreement with ABAC is also in place at Middle Georgia State University in Macon and Valdosta State University in Valdosta.    Students enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program at PCOM Georgia may enhance their credentials by pursuing concentrations in three pharmacy practice areas including acute, ambulatory and managed care. In addition, PharmD students may pursue one of three graduate business programs offered in partnership with Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pa.    PCOM President and CEO, Jay S. Feldstein, DO ’81, said, “Now with two campuses in Georgia, PCOM strives to impact all regions of the state.

The Honors Program, mentored research with professors, welcoming clubs and organizations, and being able to bring my horse to the stables on campus are just a few. Another perk of attending ABAC is the affordability which helps my family which has four children. The friends and memories I've made here are unforgettable and I'm so happy that ABAC is my school.

https://www.abac.edu	h3			Sweetwater Junction to Highlight ABAC Scholarship Fundraiser Feb. 29
https://www.abac.edu	div			    TIFTON—Fabulous food, fantastic entertainment, and a chance to assist students in securing the education of a lifetime will be the key ingredients at An Evening for ABAC scholarship fundraiser on Feb. 29.     Sponsored by the Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Foundation, Inc., the event includes a cocktail reception, silent and live auctions, dinner, and superb entertainment from Sweetwater Junction, a group with a repertoire that covers classic rock, rhythm and blues, country, and favorite hits from the past five decades.     Scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. at the Tifton Campus Conference Center, An Evening for ABAC grows the ABAC student scholarship fund each year so that freshmen can wrap themselves in the ABAC experience when they enroll in the 2020 fall semester.      Now a fully credentialed four-year college, ABAC always attracts alumni to the event who remember when the college was a two-year college from 1933 to 2008.    “An Evening for ABAC in 2019 was one of the most successful in the 48 years the ABAC Foundation has sponsored the event,” ABAC Vice President for External Affairs and Advancement Paul Williams said.  “We had around 500 alumni and supporters who helped us raise over $104,000 for student scholarships.  That means 41 students got a scholarship to ABAC because of this event.”     ABAC Arts Connection Director Wayne Jones, who helps to coordinate the event for the ABAC Foundation, said the all-time record for An Evening for ABAC took place in 2018 when the event raised $106,144 which resulted in 42 ABAC student scholarships.      Community support has been ongoing since 1972 when the ABAC Foundation sponsored a fundraiser featuring Anita Bryant to complete the funding for the Chapel of All Faiths.  The banquet attracted 426 patrons and netted $22,612.  In 1973, Eddie Arnold came to town for another ABAC Foundation-sponsored event, and the legendary program called Dollars for Scholars was born.    Dollars for Scholars became the social event of the year in Tift County with entertainers such as Ray Stevens, Louise Mandrell, Debbie Reynolds, Kathy Mattea, Marie Osmond, Helen Reddy, Lee Greenwood, Ronnie Milsap, Lorrie Morgan, and the Temptations.      Trisha Yearwood attracted the largest crowd for Dollars for Scholars in 2006 when over 1,800 patrons attended her show.  The ABAC Foundation changed the name of the event to An Evening for ABAC in 2008 and focused its efforts entirely on raising funds for scholarships.      Jodie Snow, Class of 2000 at ABAC and now the ABAC Foundation’s chief operating officer, knows how vital that scholarship support is to the students.    “The debt assumed by many students is staggering,” Snow said. “If ABAC students are to leave school with a minimum debt load, most will require financial assistance. The advancement office and the Foundation are crucial to maintaining affordability for an ABAC student’s education and allowing them to graduate with minimum debt.”    Tickets for An Evening for ABAC are $125 for singles, $225 for couples, and $1,500 for a reserved table which seats eight persons.  A portion of the ticket price is tax deductible. For tickets, interested persons can visit www.abac.edu/aneveningforabac or call (229) 391-4895.     ABAC Advancement Officer Ric Stewart said sponsors are vital to the success of An Evening for ABAC.  Sponsorship levels include ABAC 1908 Circle for $15,000 which sponsors six scholarships, Presidential for $10,000 which sponsors four scholarships, Titanium for $7,500 which sponsors three scholarships, Platinum for $5,000 which sponsors two scholarships, and Gold for $2,500 which sponsors one scholarship.  Details on sponsorships are available from Stewart at richard.stewart@abac.edu  or by calling (229) 391-5234.    Tift Regional Medical Center, Colquitt Regional Medical Center, and Ashley and Dean Copelan are already on board for ABAC 1908 Circle sponsorships.  Platinum sponsors include Sodexo, Georgia Farm Bureau, Allstate Construction, Needmore Properties, and Synovus/Synovus Trust.      Gold sponsors include AgGeorgia Farm Credit, Mr. and Mrs. James Lee Adams, South Georgia Banking Company, Robert McLendon Farms, Ardry Trading Company, Dr. Joseph J. Day, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Checkers and Captain D’s, Melvin and Anita Merrill, Georgia Power, McLendon Acres, Premium Peanut, and Vivien and Austin Scott.                                                   ###

https://www.abac.edu	h3			ABAC Arts Series Stages Shakespeare Classic on January 28
https://www.abac.edu	div			 TIFTON—Shakespeare comes to Tifton on Jan. 28 when Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College presents the National Players’ production of “As You Like It” at 7 p.m. at the Tift County High School Performing Arts Center.     With a 10-person ensemble, the National Players meld classic language with a contemporary staging of Shakespeare’s imaginative tale about city folk venturing into the woods. Research indicates that Shakespeare wrote “As You Like It” in 1599. The performance is a part of the ABAC Art Connection’s ABAC Presents! Performing Arts Series.     “‘As You Like It’ is really a romantic comedy about girls, boys, losing oneself, and finding oneself again,” ABAC Arts Connection Director Wayne Jones said. “It’s a privilege for ABAC to bring a Shakespeare classic to Tifton.”     Jones said the play involves Rosalind’s banishment from the only home she’s ever known to the Forest of Arden with her cousin, Celia, and the court jester, Touchstone. While disguised as a man, Rosalind meets fellow outcasts in the forest, including the dashing and lovesick Orlando. Determined to woo him, Rosalind persuades Orlando in her male disguise to win her heart. Her intention is to find out if Orlando truly loves her. Limited tickets will be available at a cost of $20 for adults and $10 for students. Interested persons can purchase tickets at www.purplepass.com/abac or call (229) 391-4895. The performance is supported in part by Southwell.     Other events in the ABAC Presents! Performing Arts Series include the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players in “The Pirates of Penzance” on Feb. 7 at the TCHS Performing Arts Center, the Dallas Brass on March 5 in the Tift Theatre in downtown Tifton, and jazz vocalist Myrna Clayton with the ABAC Jazz Ensemble on April 16 in Howard Auditorium on the ABAC campus.     The ABAC performing arts series is supported in part by the Georgia Council for the Arts through the appropriations of the Georgia General Assembly. The Georgia Council for the Arts also receives support from its partner agency, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). This project is supported in part by an award from the NEA.     The ABAC Presents! Performing Arts Series sponsor is Wonders of Wood. Southwell is the premium event sponsor. Event sponsors include Dr. Joseph J. Day, Ponder’s, Hilton Garden Inn of Tifton, and Julie Hunt. Preferred sponsors are McDonald’s/Tifton Housing Authority, Prince Automotive Group, Rotary Club of Tifton, and South Georgia Banking Company.     Community partners are Bowen-Donaldson Home for Funerals, Chicago Pizza and Pasta, and The Floor Shoppe at Glynn Hendricks Interiors.

https://www.abac.edu	h3			Get Your Own Robot at ABAC’s Georgia Museum of Ag on January 25
https://www.abac.edu	div			 TIFTON—Visitors can begin the new decade with their very own robot when they attend a new exhibition on Jan. 25 at the Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Georgia Museum of Agriculture.     Titled “Rust and Recreation,” the exhibition of 70 robots by Columbus native Dave Clegg will include several with price tags on them.     “‘Rust & Recreation’ celebrates the fact that there is a treasure trove of beautifully aging vintage objects out there just waiting to be discovered and assembled into something new,” Museum Curator Polly Huff said.  “Many of the robots have been given clever and descriptive names, and most of the robots in the exhibition will be available for purchase.”     In a 10 a.m. to noon gathering in the Museum Gallery on Jan. 25, guests can meet Clegg, participate in a conversation about his work, tour his very first public exhibition, and enjoy coffee and pastries. “Rust & Recreation”will open during the Annual Wiregrass Plant and Seed Swap at the Museum Gallery.     After graduating from Georgia State University in 1980 with a major in Graphic Design, Clegg had a long and fulfilling career as an illustrator. His clients have included Sports Illustrated, Hardee’s, Scholastic, Jelly Belly Candy Company and Ranger Rick Magazine.     The 2005 animated film “Robots” made a huge impression on Clegg, who is a self-confessed lover of retro sci-fi character design, especially the older models with their dents, scratches and faded paint.     “Inspired to create robots of his own, Dave began collecting found objects, mostly things from around the house that were no longer of use,” Huff said.  “Soon, he was frequenting thrift stores in search of anything metal, which led to his earliest creations being composed mostly of pots, pans, candlesticks and the like.”      Clegg’s illustration career was keeping him very busy during this time, and he eventually abandoned the robots for about a decade. Fast-forward to late 2017 when he was cleaning the basement, not knowing what to do with the unfinished robots and parts.     Eventually he decided to complete a few of them and dispose of everything else. During this process, it became clear that he would need more than just the parts on hand. During a visit to a local antique mall, Clegg ran across a vintage tobacco tin with a great patina. This was the beginning of a new direction. He had found renewed inspiration, and soon he was hooked on building robots once again.     Throughout 2018, Clegg and his wife scoured thrift stores, flea markets and antique malls across North Georgia in search of vintage objects such as wrenches, pliers, springs, opera glasses, lanterns, and clocks.  By the end of the year, he had completed 37 robots. He was beginning to develop a style of his own, which continues to evolve. Clegg has now completed over 70 bots.     “We spent over a year working out all the details, and in the end, a unique exhibit spotlighting the robots was curated and is being displayed in public for the very first time by the Gallery of ABAC’s Georgia Museum of Agriculture,” Huff said.     “Rust & Recreation” will remain on display through July 3.  Admission to this exhibit is included in the GMA’s daily admission, free to ABAC students, faculty and staff with an ABAC ID, and free to GMA Annual Pass holders.     The Museum is open from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. on Jan. 25.  For more information on this and future exhibits, interested persons can contact Huff at phuff@abac.edu.    ###

https://www.abac.edu	h3			Auditions for ‘The Spitfire Grill’ at ABAC on January 21-22
https://www.abac.edu	div			 TIFTON—Auditions for the Baldwin Players upcoming musical, “The Spitfire Grill,” will be held on Jan. 21-22 at 6:30 p.m. each night in Room 319 of Conger Hall on the campus of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College.    Dr. Brian Ray, Director of the Baldwin Players and a Professor of English and Theatre at ABAC, said those who plan to audition should prepare one verse of a country song or one verse of a traditional church hymn to be performed acapella or with recorded accompaniment. There will also be a cold read of selected passages from the script.  Copies of the script will be available at the audition.     Ray said the auditions are open to all interested ABAC students, ABAC faculty and staff members, and members of the community.  Parts are available for four women and three men.  “The Spitfire Grill” will be staged March 26-28 in ABAC’s Howard Auditorium.    “This spirited musical is based on the Lee David Zlotoff movie of the same title,” Ray said.  “In the play, a young woman recently paroled from prison seeks to find a quiet town where she can start over.    “She finds such a place in northern Wisconsin and begins her journey to self-understanding. Along the way, she encounters some quirky townsfolk, a job at a down-on-its-luck eatery, The Spitfire Grill.  It’s the only restaurant in town and home to some small-town secrets.”    Ray said that during the play, the young woman finds some answers, some friends, and a place she can feel at home. Her journey of self-renewal results in a journey of reawakening and renewal for the town as well.    For more information on auditions or the play, interested persons can contact Ray at bray@abac.edu .    ###

https://www.abac.edu	div			 BAINBRIDGE—Classically trained veteran performers will combine an awesome sound with side-splitting comedy on Jan. 16 when the Carter Arts and Lecture Series at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Bainbridge features Three Redneck Tenors.     Dr. Michael Kirkland, Executive Director of ABAC Bainbridge, said the audience should experience some great music mixed with a lot of laughter.     “I have always heard that laughter is good for the soul,” Kirkland said.  “This is going to be a fun evening for everyone.”    Mixing down home laughs with big city music, Three Redneck Tenors were top finalists on “America’s Got Talent.”  Performing together since 2006, the group delights audiences with its vocal prowess in a delightful evening of songs and music.    Kirkland said Three Redneck Tenors will perform at 6 p.m. on Jan. 16 at the Charles H. Kirbo Regional Center at ABAC Bainbridge.  The Thomas M. Kirbo and Irene B. Kirbo Foundation is the series sponsor.  The performance is supported in part by the ABAC Alumni Association.     Now in its seventh season, the Carter Arts and Lecture Series features compelling speakers, distinguished authors, and performing artists at ABAC Bainbridge.  Kirkland said the events are designed to bring ABAC students and the community together to educate, inspire, and spark imagination.    Other presentations in the Carter Arts and Lecture Series include Mike Wiley in “Breach of Peace” on Feb. 21, historian Michael Francis on March 12, and jazz vocalist Myrna Clayton with the ABAC Jazz Ensemble on April 17.      Tickets for the series are $40 for adults and $15 for students 18 and under.  Tickets can be purchased online at www.purplepass.com/Carter or by calling (229) 243-6980.

https://www.abac.edu	div			 TIFTON—If you like the music of Tom Petty, you will love the Southern Accents’ show titled “The Ultimate Tom Petty Experience” on Jan. 30 at 7:30 p.m. at the historic Tift Theatre in downtown Tifton.    Presented by Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College as a part of the new ABAC at the Tift series, the show was originally scheduled for Feb. 13 but had to be moved because of a revised schedule by Southern Accents.    ABAC Arts Connection Director Wayne Jones said the show should be a great experience for devotees of Petty’s famous sound.    “They play it like it is their very own music while showing respect to the original creator,” Jones said.  “The Tift Theatre is a perfect venue for this show.”    Petty, a Gainesville, Fla., native, passed away in 2017 at the age of 66.  He left behind such classic hits as “American Girl,” “Don’t Do Me Like That,” “Learning to Fly,” “Free Fallin,’” “Mary Jane’s Last Dance,” and “I Won’t Back Down.”    Southern Accents promises to bring all the timeless melodies, sweet rhythms, and rock music of Petty to the stage so that everyone can experience and fall in love with these songs all over again.    Jones said the depth and care that Southern Accents puts into their stage presence separates them from other tribute bands.  Tickets can be purchased online at www.purplepass.com/ABAC or by calling (229) 391-4895.  Tickets will be available at the door at a cost of $35 each.    Cornell Gunter’s Coasters will be the final concert in the ABAC at the Tift series on April 30.    ###

https://www.abac.edu/admissions	h2			ABOUT Admissions
https://www.abac.edu/admissions	p			We understand; there’s a lot to consider when it comes to choosing the right college. Is it the right size? Is it in my budget? Will I feel like I belong there?
https://www.abac.edu/admissions	p			When it comes to ABAC, we say yes, yes, and yes.
https://www.abac.edu/admissions	p		em	Student success comes first in everything we do. Our small class sizes have a student to teacher ratio of 24:1 making individual attention from professors the standard. ABAC has also been named a 
https://www.abac.edu/admissions	em			Best Value School
https://www.abac.edu/admissions	p			 by University Research and Review five times. We don’t think a great education should leave you with a mountain of debt after graduation.
https://www.abac.edu/admissions	p			The ABAC family welcomes all and takes great pride in our close-knit community. Students have a wealth of opportunities to connect with those who share interests and hobbies through one of our more than 50 student organizations. Our graduates leave not only with a top-tier education, but lifelong friendships and a great pride in their alma mater.
https://www.abac.edu/admissions	p			ABAC President Dr. David Bridges, Class of 1978, puts it best: “There are two kinds of people in this world. Those who attended ABAC, and those who wish they had.”

http://www.abac.edu	p			 TIFTON—Always a major player when it comes to economic impact, Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College hit a home run during the 2018 fiscal year when ABAC impacted South Georgia to the tune of a half billion dollars.    “ABAC’s footprint in South Georgia makes quite a large impression,” Dr. Renata Elad, Dean of ABAC’s Stafford School of Business, said.  “As a result of the overall multiplier effect, ABAC’s economic impact was $499,403,672 in 2018.”    Elad analyzed the overall University System of Georgia (USG) report which was conducted by Dr. Jeffrey M. Humphreys, Director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth in the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business.    “Out-of-state enrollment definitely played a part,” Elad said.  “Obviously, the word is getting around that ABAC offers a valuable education at an affordable cost.”    The USG report covered the 2017 fall term and the spring and summer terms of 2018.  During the 2017 fall semester, ABAC enrolled 3,394 students from 24 countries, 18 states, and 155 of Georgia’s 159 counties.     “With direct student spending of $44,729,654 impacting the region and an overall labor income impact of over $60 million regionally, ABAC is a strong partner in regional growth,” Elad said.  “ABAC has a significant footprint in Tift, Worth, Cook, Colquitt, Irwin, Turner, Decatur, Seminole, Miller, Grady, Early, Thomas, Mitchell, and Baker counties.”     Elad said household spending increased in nine categories in 2018.    “Nationally, nine of the 10 largest components of household spending increased,” Elad said.  “The 7.8 percent rise in personal insurance and pensions expenditures was the largest percentage increase among all major components followed by a 2.5 percent increase in food spending.”    The 26 USG colleges and universities had a $17.7 billion impact on communities across Georgia in 2018, an increase of almost five percent over the previous fiscal year.  The USG also created 168,284 direct and indirect jobs, a nearly three percent increase over the previous fiscal year.    “While we remain focused on graduating more students, keeping college affordable, and increasing our efficiency in delivering a quality education, we are proud our colleges and universities help power Georgia’s economy,” USG Chancellor Steve Wrigley said.  “USG and its 26 institutions play an important role in generating jobs and boosting businesses across the state, befitting the investment Georgia’s leaders have made in us.”    The latest version of the annual study on the USG’s statewide economic impact concluded that, on average, every dollar of initial spending generates an additional 47 cents for the economy of the region that hosts the institution.    Of the USG jobs number, the report found that 30 percent are on campus and 70 percent are off-campus in either the private or public sectors.  On average, for each job created on campus 2.3 off-campus jobs are created as a result.  The jobs generated by the USG account for 3.8 percent of all the nonfarm jobs in Georgia, or about 1 job in 26.                                                                      ###

http://www.abac.edu	h3			Business of ABAC Never Far from Mind of David Bridges
http://www.abac.edu	p			 By Mike Chason    Running a business with a budget of $64 million a year would consume every waking moment of most individuals.  Dr. David Bridges, president of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, is no exception.    “The big difference between running a business and being the president of ABAC is our return on investment is very complicated,” Bridges, the longest serving president of the 26 institutions in the University System of Georgia (USG), said.  “Our return would have to be calculated over the lives and careers of our graduates.”     Dr. David Bridges just began his 14th year as the ABAC President.     Since Bridges became the 10th president in the history of ABAC on July 1, 2006, over 7,000 graduates have received their ABAC diplomas.   Unlike a company that makes only one product and that product eventually rusts away or in the case of food, gets eaten, Bridges hopes that ABAC graduates continue to thrive and build more businesses.    “Students are our business, and our graduates start businesses of their own,” Bridges said.  “During their lives, our graduates generate economic impact in their communities so the ABAC investment continues to grow.”    The latest statewide economic impact study commissioned by the USG showed that ABAC’s economic impact on South Georgia skyrocketed to a record $529,838,507 in fiscal year 2017.  The multiplier effect turned 444 jobs at ABAC into 1,382 jobs off campus for a total impact of 1,826 jobs in South Georgia.    “More jobs at ABAC means more jobs in South Georgia,” Dr. Renata Elad, Dean of the Stafford School of Business at ABAC, said.  “ABAC had a much bigger employment impact plus the cost of housing went up, and the average rent in Tifton went up that year.  Personal expenses for entertainment, apparel, and services were also up.”    Elad analyzed the USG numbers for ABAC and found the ABAC economic impact a monumental 31 per cent higher than the $369,874,664 impact in the 2016 fiscal year.    “ABAC needs South Georgia, and South Georgia needs ABAC,” Elad said in her analysis.  “With total employment of over 1,800 jobs directly from student spending activities and an overall labor impact of almost $66 million, ABAC is definitely a strong partner in regional growth.”    Bridges pointed out that those numbers reflect only South Georgia and the college has changed quite a bit since the study was conducted in 2017.  Bainbridge State College merged with ABAC in 2018, leading to a record enrollment of 4,291 students during the 2018 fall semester.     ABAC attracted students from 30 countries, 18 states, and 155 of Georgia’s 159 counties during the 2018 fall term.  Because of the consolidation, ABAC offered classes in Bainbridge, Blakely, and Donalsonville besides its classes in Tifton and Moultrie.    Many of those students choose to stay at ABAC to complete one of 12 four-year degree programs.   ABAC offered only two-year degrees from 1933 to 2008.  Instead of staying two or three years at ABAC for an associate degree, students remain at ABAC four or five years to complete their bachelor’s degree.      With a bachelor’s degree in hand, graduates have more to offer the world of work.  That expands the ABAC economic impact even further because graduates find higher paying jobs.     ABAC President David Bridges (r) with ABAC Director of Facilities and Land Resources Tim Carpenter (l) look over plans for the Fine Arts building with Jody Buchan from Allstate Construction.     Besides the $64 million annual budget, there’s also the matter of capital investment at ABAC.  Since Bridges’ presidency began, over $84 million in capital projects have been completed or are in the construction phase at ABAC.      Those projects include the Health Sciences building at $7.2 million, ABAC Lakeside at $17 million, Historic Front of Campus at $15.5 million, King Hall at $2.7 million, Donaldson Dining Hall at $4 million, Thrash Wellness Center at $4.5 million, the Laboratory Sciences building at $7.2 million, and the ongoing Carlton Center/Fine Arts Building project at $24 million.  Road improvement adds another $2 million.    “Each of these projects has made this campus better,” Bridges said.  “That plays a part in recruitment of students as well.   When students visit ABAC, they like what they see here.”    Bridges takes advantage of every waking moment to promote ABAC.  His stamina is legendary as is his ability to get things done.  Since his first day on the job, he has been on the move with a wide variety of activities, many of them in the first time ever category.    Bridges’ presidential inauguration at ABAC in 2006 was the first time that ABAC has had an inauguration ceremony.  He kicked a soccer ball into the net to announce the first ever women’s soccer program.  He also pushed a plunger to set off a small charge of dynamite to open the construction on the ABAC Lakeside student housing complex.      ABAC President David Bridges at his inauguration ceremony on Aug. 25, 2006.  It was the first inauguration ceremony for a president in the history of ABAC.     Bridges assisted 103-year-old ABAC alumnus Ethel Arnold Talley when she rang the original ABAC bell at the opening of the Historic Front of Campus project, honored the memory of ABAC alumnus and Medal of Honor recipient Harold Bascom Durham, Jr., at the opening of the Freedom Gallery, and used a cross-cut saw on a log to announce the beginning of ABAC bachelor’s degrees in forestry and wildlife.    With a great sense of pride in his alma mater, Bridges watched fireworks explode over the campus at the conclusion of ABAC’s 100th birthday celebration.  He guided the process when the former Georgia Agrirama became a part of the ABAC campus as the Georgia Museum of Agriculture and Historic Village, headed up the consolidation with Bainbridge State College, and served as Interim Director of Georgia’s first ever Center for Rural Prosperity and Innovation.    “Rural communities have very tangible benefits to offer society as a whole,” Bridges said of Georgia’s Rural Center.   “The Center has a statewide mission and one of the tenets to that mission is to find a path to prosperity for rural communities.”    All these projects took mammoth amounts of time for the ABAC President whose day often begins in the pre-dawn stillness with breakfast at the Northside Café in Tifton.     During the past 13 years, Bridges has enlisted the support of legislators under the Golden Dome for ABAC projects, spoken to civic clubs and community groups far and wide, accepted the award as the Arts Citizen of the Year for Tift County, and received the USG Gold Outstanding Customer Service Leadership Award.     Bridges, who turned 61 in June, points to the establishment of ABAC as a State College as the proudest accomplishment of his tenure.    “That changed everything,” Bridges said.  “Otherwise we would be floundering.  The ability to offer bachelor’s degrees changed ABAC forever.”    Most chief operating officers develop their own management style or try to duplicate the style of other successful leaders of organizations.  Bridges believes his style hasn’t changed much since 2006.    “In some ways, I am a little more patient now than I was when I first became president,” Bridges said.  “In other ways, I think I’m less patient.  General George Patton said, ‘lead, follow, or get out of the way.’  I like that.    “My role is to get people to have a vision of where ABAC needs to go.  Ultimately, most people know the right thing to do.  It’s just a matter of getting them to do it.  Sometimes they need to be nudged a little bit.”    Dealing with the many complexities of the job is often the most difficult part of being the head of a major corporation or in Bridges’ case, a college.    “The biggest challenge is meeting the expectations of people,” Bridges said.  “In our case, that means students, parents of students, faculty, staff, alumni, donors, friends of the college, and the public.  Sometimes people come to the table with totally unrealistic expectations.    “Take students for example.  Some students expect to breeze through college just the way they breezed through high school.  College is different than high school.  Students and parents come to understand that.  Sometimes it takes a while.”    When asked what provides him with the most satisfaction as the ABAC President, Bridges points to two days every year.    “Fall graduation and spring graduation,” Bridges said.  “The graduates have cleared that hurdle.   They have diplomas.  Our expectation is that they will go out and do something with those degrees.”    When he left the tiny town of Parrott in Terrell County in 1976 to attend ABAC, Bridges had no idea he would meet his wife, Kim, in Rosalyn Donaldson’s English class and that one day he would become the only ABAC President who was once a student at the college.       ABAC President David Bridges spends countless hours speaking on his favorite topic, ABAC.     “It was never my dream to become president of ABAC,” Bridges said.  “In fact, I never really thought about it.  Even when I was 40 years old, I hadn’t thought about it.    “I have had opportunities to leave but I always asked myself, ‘is that a better fit for me than ABAC?’” Bridges said.   “ABAC has been a pretty good fit for me.”    Bridges has far surpassed the average tenure of seven years for a college president.  In fact, he is now the second longest serving president in the history of ABAC.  George P. Donaldson was the ABAC president for 14 years from 1947-61.  Bridges has 13 under his belt and is steaming full speed ahead into his 14th year.    “Lucky 13 is over, and now we’ll see what happens in 14,” Bridges said.    Is being president of ABAC in 2019 harder than being president of ABAC was in 2006?    “Oh yes, a lot harder,” Bridges said.  “Now, everybody wants to tell you how to do your business. In 2006, we didn’t have to worry about cyber-security threats.  I didn’t have so many people looking over my shoulder.      “People in our society today tend to be less self-reliant, more contentious, and more self-absorbed.  There seems to be tension about everything, particularly when it comes to political correctness.  People are hyper-sensitive about being offended.  It becomes more pervasive every day.    “It keeps us from focusing on our central mission because we’re dealing with all this other stuff.  My goal is to get something done and make ABAC a better place.”    But one day, there will be a life for Bridges after his ABAC career is completed.    “Sure, that day will come,” Bridges said.  “When it does, I want to continue to be active in the public service sector but in a less prominent way.  I’ll go back to the farm and be a part of something that’s not seven days a week, 24 hours a day.”    Bridges owns the family farm in Terrell County and retreats there as often as possible.  But wherever he goes, ABAC is always on his mind.    “I don’t worry about the day-to-day operation because we have great people to carry on,” Bridges said.  “But it’s always something.  It’s usually an external factor that can cause the wheels to come off fairly quickly.”    Until that retirement day comes, Bridges finds it easy to motivate himself to stay true to the ABAC mission every day.    “We have made great progress,” Bridges said.  “But there’s still a lot to be done.”    ###

http://www.abac.edu	p			" TIFTON/SUWANEE -- An agreement was recently reached which will allow Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College (ABAC) students seeking careers as pharmacists to earn doctoral degrees a year early at PCOM Georgia. The Suwanee campus of Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM) is the home of the College’s PCOM School of Pharmacy.    Dr. Matthew Anderson, Dean of the ABAC School of Arts and Sciences, said, “We are very excited about this new venture with PCOM, which is sure to be of tremendous benefit to our students and the broader region. This agreement will allow students to complete their combined bachelor and doctoral level education in a shorter time frame, which will make this advanced training more accessible and prepare more pharmacists to enter the workforce.""    According to Shawn Spencer, PhD RPh, Dean of the PCOM School of Pharmacy, the agreement will allow eligible ABAC students to enter the pharmacy school after completing their junior year of college.  Students who meet the School of Pharmacy requirements may matriculate into professional school before graduating from ABAC and will have the opportunity to earn a combined BS-PharmD while at PCOM Georgia.    Dr. Spencer explained that after completion of the second year of pharmacy school, these students will be eligible to receive their bachelor’s degree from ABAC having earned the required credits during their first two years at PCOM Georgia. Therefore, students can begin their careers early while saving tuition dollars.      Dr. Spencer said, “We continually strive to add value for our students. We’re very pleased about ABAC’s partnership with us and will continue to support Georgia residents entering the region’s healthcare workforce.”    An articulation agreement similar to the agreement with ABAC is also in place at Middle Georgia State University in Macon and Valdosta State University in Valdosta.    Students enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program at PCOM Georgia may enhance their credentials by pursuing concentrations in three pharmacy practice areas including acute, ambulatory and managed care. In addition, PharmD students may pursue one of three graduate business programs offered in partnership with Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pa.    PCOM President and CEO, Jay S. Feldstein, DO ’81, said, “Now with two campuses in Georgia, PCOM strives to impact all regions of the state. With this new partnership with ABAC, we will save our students from the South Georgia region both time and tuition dollars in hopes that they will return to South Georgia to practice pharmacy.”      About Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College    Since 1908, Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton has provided unique, hands-on learning opportunities for students as the South’s premier destination for agriculture and natural resources.   The ABAC curriculum has grown tremendously, now including a wide range of more traditional four-year degrees and paths to success including a highly regarded nursing program, innovative arts and science tracks, and an ever-growing list of learning opportunities and majors for its students.

http://www.abac.edu	h3			Sweetwater Junction to Highlight ABAC Scholarship Fundraiser Feb. 29
http://www.abac.edu	div			    TIFTON—Fabulous food, fantastic entertainment, and a chance to assist students in securing the education of a lifetime will be the key ingredients at An Evening for ABAC scholarship fundraiser on Feb. 29.     Sponsored by the Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Foundation, Inc., the event includes a cocktail reception, silent and live auctions, dinner, and superb entertainment from Sweetwater Junction, a group with a repertoire that covers classic rock, rhythm and blues, country, and favorite hits from the past five decades.     Scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. at the Tifton Campus Conference Center, An Evening for ABAC grows the ABAC student scholarship fund each year so that freshmen can wrap themselves in the ABAC experience when they enroll in the 2020 fall semester.      Now a fully credentialed four-year college, ABAC always attracts alumni to the event who remember when the college was a two-year college from 1933 to 2008.    “An Evening for ABAC in 2019 was one of the most successful in the 48 years the ABAC Foundation has sponsored the event,” ABAC Vice President for External Affairs and Advancement Paul Williams said.  “We had around 500 alumni and supporters who helped us raise over $104,000 for student scholarships.  That means 41 students got a scholarship to ABAC because of this event.”     ABAC Arts Connection Director Wayne Jones, who helps to coordinate the event for the ABAC Foundation, said the all-time record for An Evening for ABAC took place in 2018 when the event raised $106,144 which resulted in 42 ABAC student scholarships.      Community support has been ongoing since 1972 when the ABAC Foundation sponsored a fundraiser featuring Anita Bryant to complete the funding for the Chapel of All Faiths.  The banquet attracted 426 patrons and netted $22,612.  In 1973, Eddie Arnold came to town for another ABAC Foundation-sponsored event, and the legendary program called Dollars for Scholars was born.    Dollars for Scholars became the social event of the year in Tift County with entertainers such as Ray Stevens, Louise Mandrell, Debbie Reynolds, Kathy Mattea, Marie Osmond, Helen Reddy, Lee Greenwood, Ronnie Milsap, Lorrie Morgan, and the Temptations.      Trisha Yearwood attracted the largest crowd for Dollars for Scholars in 2006 when over 1,800 patrons attended her show.  The ABAC Foundation changed the name of the event to An Evening for ABAC in 2008 and focused its efforts entirely on raising funds for scholarships.      Jodie Snow, Class of 2000 at ABAC and now the ABAC Foundation’s chief operating officer, knows how vital that scholarship support is to the students.    “The debt assumed by many students is staggering,” Snow said. “If ABAC students are to leave school with a minimum debt load, most will require financial assistance. The advancement office and the Foundation are crucial to maintaining affordability for an ABAC student’s education and allowing them to graduate with minimum debt.”    Tickets for An Evening for ABAC are $125 for singles, $225 for couples, and $1,500 for a reserved table which seats eight persons.  A portion of the ticket price is tax deductible. For tickets, interested persons can visit www.abac.edu/aneveningforabac or call (229) 391-4895.     ABAC Advancement Officer Ric Stewart said sponsors are vital to the success of An Evening for ABAC.  Sponsorship levels include ABAC 1908 Circle for $15,000 which sponsors six scholarships, Presidential for $10,000 which sponsors four scholarships, Titanium for $7,500 which sponsors three scholarships, Platinum for $5,000 which sponsors two scholarships, and Gold for $2,500 which sponsors one scholarship.  Details on sponsorships are available from Stewart at richard.stewart@abac.edu  or by calling (229) 391-5234.    Tift Regional Medical Center, Colquitt Regional Medical Center, and Ashley and Dean Copelan are already on board for ABAC 1908 Circle sponsorships.  Platinum sponsors include Sodexo, Georgia Farm Bureau, Allstate Construction, Needmore Properties, and Synovus/Synovus Trust.      Gold sponsors include AgGeorgia Farm Credit, Mr. and Mrs. James Lee Adams, South Georgia Banking Company, Robert McLendon Farms, Ardry Trading Company, Dr. Joseph J. Day, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Checkers and Captain D’s, Melvin and Anita Merrill, Georgia Power, McLendon Acres, Premium Peanut, and Vivien and Austin Scott.                                                   ###

http://www.abac.edu	div			 TIFTON—Shakespeare comes to Tifton on Jan. 28 when Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College presents the National Players’ production of “As You Like It” at 7 p.m. at the Tift County High School Performing Arts Center.     With a 10-person ensemble, the National Players meld classic language with a contemporary staging of Shakespeare’s imaginative tale about city folk venturing into the woods. Research indicates that Shakespeare wrote “As You Like It” in 1599. The performance is a part of the ABAC Art Connection’s ABAC Presents! Performing Arts Series.     “‘As You Like It’ is really a romantic comedy about girls, boys, losing oneself, and finding oneself again,” ABAC Arts Connection Director Wayne Jones said. “It’s a privilege for ABAC to bring a Shakespeare classic to Tifton.”     Jones said the play involves Rosalind’s banishment from the only home she’s ever known to the Forest of Arden with her cousin, Celia, and the court jester, Touchstone. While disguised as a man, Rosalind meets fellow outcasts in the forest, including the dashing and lovesick Orlando. Determined to woo him, Rosalind persuades Orlando in her male disguise to win her heart. Her intention is to find out if Orlando truly loves her. Limited tickets will be available at a cost of $20 for adults and $10 for students. Interested persons can purchase tickets at www.purplepass.com/abac or call (229) 391-4895. The performance is supported in part by Southwell.     Other events in the ABAC Presents! Performing Arts Series include the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players in “The Pirates of Penzance” on Feb. 7 at the TCHS Performing Arts Center, the Dallas Brass on March 5 in the Tift Theatre in downtown Tifton, and jazz vocalist Myrna Clayton with the ABAC Jazz Ensemble on April 16 in Howard Auditorium on the ABAC campus.     The ABAC performing arts series is supported in part by the Georgia Council for the Arts through the appropriations of the Georgia General Assembly. The Georgia Council for the Arts also receives support from its partner agency, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). This project is supported in part by an award from the NEA.     The ABAC Presents! Performing Arts Series sponsor is Wonders of Wood. Southwell is the premium event sponsor. Event sponsors include Dr. Joseph J. Day, Ponder’s, Hilton Garden Inn of Tifton, and Julie Hunt. Preferred sponsors are McDonald’s/Tifton Housing Authority, Prince Automotive Group, Rotary Club of Tifton, and South Georgia Banking Company.     Community partners are Bowen-Donaldson Home for Funerals, Chicago Pizza and Pasta, and The Floor Shoppe at Glynn Hendricks Interiors.

http://www.abac.edu	h3			Get Your Own Robot at ABAC’s Georgia Museum of Ag on January 25
http://www.abac.edu	div			 TIFTON—Visitors can begin the new decade with their very own robot when they attend a new exhibition on Jan. 25 at the Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Georgia Museum of Agriculture.     Titled “Rust and Recreation,” the exhibition of 70 robots by Columbus native Dave Clegg will include several with price tags on them.     “‘Rust & Recreation’ celebrates the fact that there is a treasure trove of beautifully aging vintage objects out there just waiting to be discovered and assembled into something new,” Museum Curator Polly Huff said.  “Many of the robots have been given clever and descriptive names, and most of the robots in the exhibition will be available for purchase.”     In a 10 a.m. to noon gathering in the Museum Gallery on Jan. 25, guests can meet Clegg, participate in a conversation about his work, tour his very first public exhibition, and enjoy coffee and pastries. “Rust & Recreation”will open during the Annual Wiregrass Plant and Seed Swap at the Museum Gallery.     After graduating from Georgia State University in 1980 with a major in Graphic Design, Clegg had a long and fulfilling career as an illustrator. His clients have included Sports Illustrated, Hardee’s, Scholastic, Jelly Belly Candy Company and Ranger Rick Magazine.     The 2005 animated film “Robots” made a huge impression on Clegg, who is a self-confessed lover of retro sci-fi character design, especially the older models with their dents, scratches and faded paint.     “Inspired to create robots of his own, Dave began collecting found objects, mostly things from around the house that were no longer of use,” Huff said.  “Soon, he was frequenting thrift stores in search of anything metal, which led to his earliest creations being composed mostly of pots, pans, candlesticks and the like.”      Clegg’s illustration career was keeping him very busy during this time, and he eventually abandoned the robots for about a decade. Fast-forward to late 2017 when he was cleaning the basement, not knowing what to do with the unfinished robots and parts.     Eventually he decided to complete a few of them and dispose of everything else. During this process, it became clear that he would need more than just the parts on hand. During a visit to a local antique mall, Clegg ran across a vintage tobacco tin with a great patina. This was the beginning of a new direction. He had found renewed inspiration, and soon he was hooked on building robots once again.     Throughout 2018, Clegg and his wife scoured thrift stores, flea markets and antique malls across North Georgia in search of vintage objects such as wrenches, pliers, springs, opera glasses, lanterns, and clocks.  By the end of the year, he had completed 37 robots. He was beginning to develop a style of his own, which continues to evolve. Clegg has now completed over 70 bots.     “We spent over a year working out all the details, and in the end, a unique exhibit spotlighting the robots was curated and is being displayed in public for the very first time by the Gallery of ABAC’s Georgia Museum of Agriculture,” Huff said.     “Rust & Recreation” will remain on display through July 3.  Admission to this exhibit is included in the GMA’s daily admission, free to ABAC students, faculty and staff with an ABAC ID, and free to GMA Annual Pass holders.     The Museum is open from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. on Jan. 25.  For more information on this and future exhibits, interested persons can contact Huff at phuff@abac.edu.    ###

Dr. Brian Ray, Director of the Baldwin Players and a Professor of English and Theatre at ABAC, said those who plan to audition should prepare one verse of a country song or one verse of a traditional church hymn to be performed acapella or with recorded accompaniment. There will also be a cold read of selected passages from the script.  Copies of the script will be available at the audition.     Ray said the auditions are open to all interested ABAC students, ABAC faculty and staff members, and members of the community.  Parts are available for four women and three men.  “The Spitfire Grill” will be staged March 26-28 in ABAC’s Howard Auditorium.    “This spirited musical is based on the Lee David Zlotoff movie of the same title,” Ray said.  “In the play, a young woman recently paroled from prison seeks to find a quiet town where she can start over.    “She finds such a place in northern Wisconsin and begins her journey to self-understanding. Along the way, she encounters some quirky townsfolk, a job at a down-on-its-luck eatery, The Spitfire Grill.  It’s the only restaurant in town and home to some small-town secrets.”    Ray said that during the play, the young woman finds some answers, some friends, and a place she can feel at home. Her journey of self-renewal results in a journey of reawakening and renewal for the town as well.    For more information on auditions or the play, interested persons can contact Ray at bray@abac.edu .    ###

http://www.abac.edu	div			 BAINBRIDGE—Classically trained veteran performers will combine an awesome sound with side-splitting comedy on Jan. 16 when the Carter Arts and Lecture Series at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Bainbridge features Three Redneck Tenors.     Dr. Michael Kirkland, Executive Director of ABAC Bainbridge, said the audience should experience some great music mixed with a lot of laughter.     “I have always heard that laughter is good for the soul,” Kirkland said.  “This is going to be a fun evening for everyone.”    Mixing down home laughs with big city music, Three Redneck Tenors were top finalists on “America’s Got Talent.”  Performing together since 2006, the group delights audiences with its vocal prowess in a delightful evening of songs and music.    Kirkland said Three Redneck Tenors will perform at 6 p.m. on Jan. 16 at the Charles H. Kirbo Regional Center at ABAC Bainbridge.  The Thomas M. Kirbo and Irene B. Kirbo Foundation is the series sponsor.  The performance is supported in part by the ABAC Alumni Association.     Now in its seventh season, the Carter Arts and Lecture Series features compelling speakers, distinguished authors, and performing artists at ABAC Bainbridge.  Kirkland said the events are designed to bring ABAC students and the community together to educate, inspire, and spark imagination.    Other presentations in the Carter Arts and Lecture Series include Mike Wiley in “Breach of Peace” on Feb. 21, historian Michael Francis on March 12, and jazz vocalist Myrna Clayton with the ABAC Jazz Ensemble on April 17.

http://www.abac.edu	div			 TIFTON—If you like the music of Tom Petty, you will love the Southern Accents’ show titled “The Ultimate Tom Petty Experience” on Jan. 30 at 7:30 p.m. at the historic Tift Theatre in downtown Tifton.    Presented by Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College as a part of the new ABAC at the Tift series, the show was originally scheduled for Feb. 13 but had to be moved because of a revised schedule by Southern Accents.    ABAC Arts Connection Director Wayne Jones said the show should be a great experience for devotees of Petty’s famous sound.    “They play it like it is their very own music while showing respect to the original creator,” Jones said.  “The Tift Theatre is a perfect venue for this show.”    Petty, a Gainesville, Fla., native, passed away in 2017 at the age of 66.  He left behind such classic hits as “American Girl,” “Don’t Do Me Like That,” “Learning to Fly,” “Free Fallin,’” “Mary Jane’s Last Dance,” and “I Won’t Back Down.”    Southern Accents promises to bring all the timeless melodies, sweet rhythms, and rock music of Petty to the stage so that everyone can experience and fall in love with these songs all over again.    Jones said the depth and care that Southern Accents puts into their stage presence separates them from other tribute bands.  Tickets can be purchased online at www.purplepass.com/ABAC or by calling (229) 391-4895.  Tickets will be available at the door at a cost of $35 each.    Cornell Gunter’s Coasters will be the final concert in the ABAC at the Tift series on April 30.    ###
