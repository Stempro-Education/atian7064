http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	h5			Why Honors
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			Why should I join the Honors College? What can it offer me?
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p			The Honors College offers its students unique and exclusive opportunities for academic success and positions students to be competitive for jobs, graduate school or other post-graduate endeavors.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p			Honors students receive:
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	li			Personal honors advising for all four years and in all majors
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	li			Small, engaging classes taught by full-time, expert faculty
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	li			Access to honors-only, credit-bearing internships, study abroad experiences and leadership development programs

http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			Are Honors courses more difficult than general courses? I want to protect my GPA so I can maintain my scholarships.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p			You’ll be thrilled to know that GPAs are, on average, actually higher in our students’ Honors courses than in their non-Honors courses. It’s most likely due to the smaller class sizes we offer and the increased emphasis on student discussion and participation.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			I want to see the Honors College for myself. How can I do that?
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p		strong	Incoming, first-year students can 
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	strong			register online for a fall information session

http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	h5			Admissions Process
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			I was accepted to Georgia State. Does that mean I was accepted to the Honors College?
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p			That’s awesome! However, admittance to Georgia State does NOT guarantee acceptance into the Honors College.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p			Continue to actively check your email. The Honors College will notify you separately via email if you have been accepted; this message is important and will include your next steps. We only notify students who have been accepted.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	li			High school seniors who apply by the November 15th priority consideration deadline may be notified as early as mid-December.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	li			All other high school applicants will be notified by mid-April.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	li			Currently enrolled Georgia State and transfer students will be notified in June.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			I'm a high school senior. If I'm not accepted to the Honors College as an incoming, first-year Georgia State student, do I have any other chances?
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p			Good news! You do.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p		a	You can apply as a currently enrolled Georgia State student toward the end of your first spring semester if you’ve successfully completed at least 24 credit hours AND you’ve maintained a Georgia State GPA of at least 3.5. More details and instructions are available under the 
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	a			Enrolled Georgia State Students tab
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			I'm a dual-enrolled student at Georgia State. Can I apply in the spring to the Honors College as an enrolled Georgia State student?
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p		a	No. Enrolled student application is restricted to enrolled bachelors degree-seeking students only. Dual enrollment/early college students will be evaluated through the 
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	a			high school student application process
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p		a	 in the fall after 
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	a			reactivating their applications.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			I'm a dual-enrolled student at another institution (not Georgia State or Perimeter). How can I be evaluated for entry into the Honors College?
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p		a	Dual enrollment/early college students at campuses other than Georgia State (Atlanta or Perimeter campuses) will be evaluated through the 
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	h5			Test Scores
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			I will be retaking the SAT/ACT after submitting my application. Will the Honors College consider my new scores?
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p			Yes! The admissions committee continues to review newly reported scores throughout the winter and spring as we continue to form our fall class. Just make sure you report all new test scores to Georgia State through College Board and email honorsadmissions@gsu.edu to let us know you’re still interested in Honors College consideration. Even if you are not initially offered admission to the Honors College with our early admission group, we will be happy to re-evaluate your file if new scores and/or grade information is reported.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			I submitted my Common Application by Nov. 15th, but my scores aren’t yet in from the testing agencies. Did I actually meet the deadline?
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p			Yes. You met the deadline for Honors consideration, but students who have a completed application file at the time of applying will take priority over students who report scores or grades after the November 15th deadline.
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	span			I self-reported my test scores for Honors College consideration. Do I still need to have testing agencies report my scores?
http://honors.gsu.edu/apply	p			Yes. Self-reported test scores are not considered official for Honors College admission requirements. You must report test scores to Georgia State (CEEB 5251) through CollegeBoard or other reporting agencies.
