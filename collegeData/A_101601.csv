http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	h2			Department Overview
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p			Swarthmore College is where intellectually passionate students think and create together for the betterment of their communities and the world.
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p			We collaborate, rather than compete. We dive deep and then put our ideas to work. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p			We believe in the power of place, knowing that students will thrive in our gorgeous arboretum campus but also appreciate the easy access to downtown Philadelphia, with a train station right at the edge of campus.
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p			We embrace the knowledge that living in a community of people with diverse backgrounds challenges our assumptions and helps us become who we want to be. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p		a	Until now, your education might have been a wonderful appetizer. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	a			Welcome to Swarthmore
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p			: an endless intellectual buffet, where curiosity and collaboration help create leaders for the common good.

http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	h2			Academic Exploration
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p		a	It's hard to feel motivated in a vacuum. That's why the quality of the people around you matters so much. Our community of thinkers and doers—of problem finders and problem solvers—gets inside your head. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	a			Everyone at Swarthmore is on an intellectual journey
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p			. After four years as a Swattie, you'll have what it takes to apply your knowledge with meaning and purpose. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	h2			Location: Best of Both Worlds
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p		a	Want to relax? Your options are almost endless. Take a nap on the sun-drenched lawn of Parrish Beach or clear your head with a trail run through the woods. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	a			Hop the train into Philadelphia
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p		a	 to chat with friends over bubble tea in Chinatown, or see your favorite band play at Franklin Music Hall. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	a			Swarthmore’s campus
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p			 is anything but an afterthought. Instead, it is a physical place that ultimately helps define your inner landscape. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	h2			Meaningful Opportunities
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p		a	Self-discovery: At Swarthmore, it’s communal. As paradoxical as that may sound, it’s true in more ways than one. Swatties sharpen their personal vision in collaboration with friends, professors, coaches, and mentors. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	a			Swarthmore offers you a wealth of opportunities
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p			 to find your place in the world and become the person you want to be.
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	h2			Quaker Roots
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	a			While Swarthmore is no longer a religious institution
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p		a	, our Quaker founders believed in the practical application of knowledge for the common good. Your classmates work to initiate positive change in fields as diverse as business, medicine, government, education, and more. Swatties strive to 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	a			make the most of their opportunities and abilities to benefit the world around them
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid	p			, just as they did more than 150 years ago.

We discourage transfer applications from students who have completed the equivalent of six or more semesters of college coursework. Students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree or higher are not eligible for transfer admission. Swarthmore admits transfer students each year for fall enrollment only.

http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	span			Swattie
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	p		span	While no individual student can epitomize all of 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	span			Swarthmore's
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	p			 values, these are qualities and attributes that we elevate in our application review process: 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	strong			Intellectual curiosity and an enthusiasm for learning: 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li			We are looking for students who genuinely enjoy learning and are uncommonly curious. Students relish the opportunities presented by our selection of 40  academic programs, an extraordinarily devoted faculty, and a one-of-a-kind honors program. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	strong			Creative and proactive problem-solving: 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li			We are intrigued by students who are flexible in their approach to learning, who are comfortable with experimentation, and who are willing to take intellectual risks that move them out of their comfort zone.
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	strong			Generosity toward others: 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li			We are looking for students who want to work with their peers, embrace collaboration, have a strong sense of empathy, and look for ways to support each other. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	strong			Civic engagement: 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li			We appreciate students who have had a sustained commitment to service, who express a genuine interest in moving our world forward, and who demonstrate an interest in improving their school or local or cultural community in a collaborative way. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	strong			Willingness to work hard and to seek help: 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li		span	The volume of commitments you will face at 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	span			Swarthmore
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li			 will demand a strong sense of organization. We are looking for students who have developed reliable work habits, an ability to focus on the task or commitment in front of them, and a willingness to use the support resources we provide. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	strong			Potential contributions to campus life: 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li			Whether you are from an urban center or a rural outpost (or somewhere in-between), we value your point of view. We are looking for students who will contribute their talents, interests, perspectives, and distinct voices to our community. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	strong			Sustained commitment: 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li			We are more interested in your focus on a few activities over time (such as work, care for parents and siblings, service, or athletics), rather than membership in a long list of clubs—although we understand that some students can balance an assortment of activities. 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	strong			Open-mindedness in general and to the liberal arts writ large: 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li		span	Our most popular major tends to be “undecided,” and we welcome everyone to the liberal arts tradition. We admit students to 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li		span	 College, not a specific major. The ideal 
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	li			 values humanities, the natural sciences and engineering, and the social sciences as lenses through which they can learn and grow.
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	dt			How We Evaluate Your Application
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	p			When you apply to Swarthmore, a committee of admissions deans reviews your application. First, at least two deans sit down together, review all of your application components, and discuss your strengths. We take into account what opportunities and resources you have had access to, your high school's curricula, your geographic location, your family background, and your cultural identity. If we believe you might be a good fit for Swarthmore, your application will move past the first review to additional reviews and discussions. By the time we offer you admission, your application may have been reviewed in as many as half a dozen committees, each of which considers the full context of your background, experiences, and opportunities.
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	p			There is no formula for admission to Swarthmore. We do not admit students based on a single factor or one admissions dean's opinion. Each admission decision is the result of a thorough, committee-based, holistic, contextual, and highly selective application evaluation.
http://www.swarthmore.edu/admissions-aid/apply-to-swarthmore	p			Swarthmore College has supported the right to peaceful assembly for more than 150 years. Your participation in nonviolent demonstrations has no negative impact on your application or admission to Swarthmore.
