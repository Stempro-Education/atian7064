https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	h2			How to Apply
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	h3			J.D. Student
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p		a	 Before you apply to Dickinson Law, you’ll need to gather some resources. But don’t worry—it may be easier than you think. To simplify the process, we’ve outlined the steps you’ll need to take to apply—and we’ve waived our application fee to help reduce the cost of applying to law school. 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			Don’t miss our tips for perfecting your law school application!
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong		a	Create an account with the 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			Law School Admission Council (LSAC).
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a	br		LSAC’s website
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 contains valuable information about the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and the Credential Assembly Service (CAS).
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong		a	Sit for the 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			LSAT
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			GRE
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 To be considered complete, applications must include a valid standardized test score. Dickinson Law accepts both the LSAT and GRE, and we encourage applicants to take whichever standardized exam best suits them. A valid score is one earned on a test administered within the past five years.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			GRE test results must be submitted to Dickinson Law through the Educational Testing Service (ETS). Please indicate Dickinson Law as a score report recipient using our Designated Institution (DI) Code of 0545.  
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			Please be advised that a GRE score may be utilized only when a reportable LSAT score does not exist. If an applicant has a reportable LSAT score on file, a GRE score will not be considered in lieu of an existing LSAT score (and applicants are not required to report GRE scores in this instance). After a candidate has been admitted with a GRE score, receipt of a subsequent LSAT score may require reevaluation of Dickinson Law’s offer of admission and scholarship. 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			To be consistent with LSAT reporting, applicants who have taken only the GRE must submit all GRE scores from the last five years. Applicants are not permitted to select GRE results individually. Note that LSAC reports all LSAT scores from the past five years in the CAS report.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong		a	Register for the 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			Credential Assembly Service
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 Regardless of which standardized test score you plan to submit, all applicants must register for the Credential Assembly Service (CAS). As part of your CAS subscription, LSAC compiles your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and LSAT score(s) (if applicable) and sends a comprehensive packet of these necessary documents to each law school to which you apply.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p		a	Please note that Dickinson Law does not require an 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			LSAC writing sample
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p		a	 for an application to be considered complete; however, applicants seeking to strengthen their files may wish to include this optional component. If an applicant has a completed LSAC writing sample on file, it will be included in your CAS report. If you submit an application and plan to submit your LSAC writing sample at a later date, you may 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			email us
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 to request that we delay review of your file until we are in receipt of your LSAC writing sample. 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong			Create your résumé.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong			Draft and edit your personal statement.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong			Request transcripts from all prior colleges and graduate programs.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong			Request letters of recommendation.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 Ask your professors and/or work supervisors if they’d be willing to write a letter of recommendation on your behalf. We require a minimum of two letters and will accept a maximum of four letters.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong			Write supplemental essay(s).
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 In addition to your personal statement, you may want to include a supplemental essay that addresses any discrepancies between your LSAT and GPA, explains how you add to the diversity of our community, or provides other relevant information to the admissions committee. Please note that you may submit more than one supplemental essay, but you are not required to submit any.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			APPLY NOW
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong			 without an application fee!
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 We’ll try to process and review your application as quickly as possible. Please be patient, however, since we read every application.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			CHECK THE STATUS
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong			 of your application.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p		a	 After you submit your application to Dickinson Law, you can use this 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			link
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 to determine whether your file is complete or if a decision has been rendered. Please note that Dickinson Law also notifies all applicants of their admission status after a decision has been rendered on your file.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	h3			Apply as a Transfer Student
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p		a	 A student in good standing at an ABA-accredited law school may 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			apply
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 to complete their final two years of legal education at Dickinson Law. To earn a J.D. from Dickinson Law, a transfer student must attend the Law School for at least four of the six semesters for which residence credit is claimed and earn at least 56 credits from Dickinson Law. A total of 88 credits are required to earn a J.D. from Dickinson Law.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			The admissions committee will conduct a holistic review of the applicant's file, with a particular emphasis on law school performance.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			As part of the transfer admission process, the admissions committee and academic deans will evaluate transferable credits. A minimum grade of C is required for all credits approved for transfer to Dickinson Law. Any credits earned at another law school are recorded on the student academic transcript by reference only, but no attempt is made to convert grades to Dickinson Law equivalents.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	h4			HOW TO APPLY
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong		a	The 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	a			transfer application

https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	li			a letter of recommendation from a law school faculty member the applicant had as an instructor for at least one class;
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	li			a J.D. CAS report (compiled by LSAC);

https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	li			a copy of a final transcript from the applicant's undergraduate degree granting school. (This is due prior to matriculation at Dickinson Law.)
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p	ul	strong	The letter of good standing and official transcript should be sent 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong			after
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p	ul		 first and second semester law school grades are recorded.
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p		strong	Decisions regarding transfer applications are made on a rolling basis, and 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	strong			it is to each applicant’s advantage to submit a transfer application and final transcripts as early as possible
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p		em	 to take advantage of programs like the 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	em			Dickinson Law Review
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p		em	 write-on competition, Moot Court, and our fall recruitment program. 
https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/apply-jd	p			 and Moot Court competitions typically take place in June. Fall recruitment deadlines typically fall in late July.
