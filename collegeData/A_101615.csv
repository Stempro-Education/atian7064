https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	section	section	ul	 Please note the following information about transfer of credits from other institutions: 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li		a	To see a suggested sequence for the requirements of each degree program view: 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	a			Texas Common Course Numbering System
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li		ul	Two sequences of American/Texas Government are taught at Texas community colleges and universities. 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			Texas Common Courses, GOVT 2305 and GOVT 2306, transfer directly as course equivalents to PSci 220 and 221, respectively.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			Texas Common Courses, GOVT 2301 and 2302, are NOT direct course equivalents for PSci 220 and 221. However, GOVT 2301 and 2302 do transfer together as a complete sequence for PSci 220 and 221.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			Due to the differences in course content at Texas community colleges and universities, it is strongly recommended that students complete the required courses in American/Texas government at the same institution. Students seeking to combine courses from the two sequences should use caution and be aware that only the following alternative combinations of GOVT 2301 and PSci 220/GOVT 2305 or GOVT 2301 and PSci 221/GOVT 2306 fulfill the content requirement of the state of Texas.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			Courses taken at junior or community colleges cannot transfer as advanced hours (course numbers beginning with a 3 or 4 indicate advanced hours).
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			The applicability of transferred credit toward a degree is subject to the preparation of an advisement guide within an academic department.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li		strong	Students must complete a minimum of sixty (60) semester hours from an upper division institution. While all credit hours presented on the sending institution’s transcripts will be evaluated and equivalent college-level courses posted to the student’s academic record, a 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	strong			maximum of sixty-six (66) semester credit hours from a junior or community college may be applied toward degree requirements.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			College preparatory course work in remedial math, reading and writing are not transferable and do not satisfy college-level requirements at A&M-Commerce.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			When a course is repeated, only the last enrollment for that course will be used in computing the grade point average. The second grade will be used to determine credit earned for the course.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			A grade of “D” is transferable, but a minimum grade of “C” is required in all undergraduate courses in the academic major.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			Courses that transfer but do not have exact equivalent numbers at A&M-Commerce are listed as generic credit. At the discretion of the major department, these courses may fulfill specific degree requirements.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			Core courses completed at other Texas public colleges and universities will satisfy core requirements at A&M-Commerce.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			The transfer grade point average will be used to determine admissibility to the University and scholarship eligibility.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			Official cumulative grade point average is calculated only on courses taken at A&M-Commerce.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	em			The equivalencies presented herein are accurate and complete at the time of publication. A&M-Commerce reserves the right to re-evaluate the transferability of specific courses offered by other institutions, and to amend University course and/or program offerings without prior notice.

Science majors must take both a lecture and a lab if choosing from this list of courses. The same lecture and lab course may not be repeated (unless failed) in order to meet the six-hour life and physical science core requirement.

https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	strong			The Admissions Application Consideration Process for Domestic Students: 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			GRE/GMAT scores must be sent directly to the University by the testing agency. It takes approximately 15 days from the time the scores are ordered for them to be received and posted.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	h3			 What is the 12-hour rule for nondegree students? 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Students may only use 12 graduate semester hours taken in a non-degree status for a master’s, specialist or doctoral degree. The graduate school strongly advises you to gain admission to a degree program before completing 12 graduate hours.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	h3			 What is provisional admission? 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p		br	Provisional admission means that the applicant’s bachelor’s degree has been conferred, but the applicant has not submitted all admission documents or test scores to A&M-Commerce, but the applicant is allowed to attend for one semester while pending the submission of all documents and/or scores. Provisional admission is not available for all degree programs and is not available to doctoral and international students. Financial Aid is available for full admission and conditional admission status only.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	h3			 What is full admission? 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p		br	Full admission to a graduate degree program (doctoral, master’s or specialist)
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			means that all requirements for admission have been met and the applicant has been accepted by the department and the Graduate School. Full admission is not the same as admission to candidacy to a graduate program. Students who have completed graduate hours at A&M-Commerce must have an overall graduate GPA of at least a 3.00 in order to gain admission to a degree program. Financial Aid is available for full admission status.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	h3			 What is conditional admission? 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Conditional admission to a graduate degree program means that all documents have been submitted for admission, but the applicant does not meet all requirements for full admission. This could be a low overall grade point average, not meeting departmental requirements, or lack of background for the chosen graduate program. Conditional admission status will change to full admission upon completing 12 graduate hours at Texas A&M University-Commerce with at least a 3.00 overall graduate grade point average. If an overall 3.00 graduate grade point average is not achieved, then the conditional admission status will change to academic suspension.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Conditional admission is not available for doctoral admission. Students who have completed graduate hours at A&M-Commerce must have an overall graduate GPA of at least a 3.00 in order to gain admission to a degree program. Financial Aid is available for conditional admission status.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	h3			 What happens if I do not meet the admissions requirements? 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Applicants who do not meet automatic admission requirements based on ranking and/or SAT/ACT scores will be reviewed by the university’s Admissions Appeal Committee. To be reviewed by the Admissions Appeal Committee, the applicant must submit the appeal form (provided with initial notification of initial denial). The Admissions Appeal Committee will not consider any appeal without receipt of the appeal form. In addition, the applicant must submit an Educational Goals Statement. In this statement, the applicant must explain his/her education goals at Texas A&M University-Commerce by answering the following three questions in paragraph form (250-500 words maximum):
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			What are your career goals and what degree programs do you intend to pursue?
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			What motivates you or why did you choose this career goal / degree plan?
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			What experience(s) and academic strengths will help you achieve these goals?
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p		a	For additional information on how to appeal the admissions decision, please email 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	h3			 What do the different graduate admission statuses mean?

https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	strong			Conditional Admission Status
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Conditional admission is available to applicants with a complete admission application packet but does not qualify for full admission.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			This conditional status could be because of a low bachelor’s degree GPA (below 2.75 for most programs/3.00 for business programs) or other departmental requirements.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			After completing 12 graduate hours, a conditional student must have an overall graduate grade point average of 3.00 or higher.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			Failure to achieve the minimum 3.0 GPA after completing 12 graduate hours will result in suspension of the student from further graduate study in any degree program for 3 years.

https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			An official GRE or GMAT score is not on file
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			One or more departmental requirements are incomplete
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Students admitted provisionally must be sure their missing documents are received by the Office of Graduate Studies and all requirements are complete before the end of the first semester of enrollment so the Graduate School can continue the admission consideration process.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Completion of the application packet and all requirements on time is the student’s responsibility. Students whose files are not complete during the semester of provisional enrollment will not be permitted to re-enroll or early register until the necessary documentation is received and admission is granted.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Financial Aid and Graduate Assistantships are not available while in provisional status.

https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	h3			 Can I transfer dual credit classes? 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Dual credit classes are college courses that you have taken through your local community college that also counted toward your high school diploma. In order to receive transfer credit from A&M-Commerce for dual credit classes, you must submit official transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions from the community college or university where you took your dual credit classes.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	h3			 Can I apply previously completed courses to my second master’s/specialist degree? 
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			Subject to the approval of the department head and graduate dean, students holding master’s/specialist degrees from a regionally accredited graduate institution in the United States may apply certain courses that were a part of a previously earned graduate degree toward a second master’s/specialist degree, provided such courses are not more than 6 years old at the time the second master’s degree is conferred.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			The number of courses to be permitted will be as follows:
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			A thesis completed for a previous degree cannot be used for a second master’s/specialist degree.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			A 595 Research Literature and Techniques course can only be used for a second master’s/specialist degree with department and Graduate School approval.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	li			All remaining courses applied to satisfy the requirements for the second master’s/specialist degree must be A&M-Commerce courses.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			The second master’s/specialist degree will be subject to the general regulations governing master’s degrees except as stated above.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p			After a degree is awarded, courses taken before the degree was awarded (regardless of whether the course is applied to the degree) cannot be repeated and the grade point average cannot be recalculated.
https://new.tamuc.edu/admissions/howto	p		a	Students who wish to pursue a second master’s/specialist degree must
