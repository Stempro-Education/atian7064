https://usao.edu	h3			build a solid foundation
https://usao.edu	p			Merriam-Webster defines the liberal arts as “college or university studies intended                                     to provide chiefly general knowledge and to develop general intellectual capacities                                     as opposed to professional or vocational skills.”                                  
https://usao.edu	p			But at the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, it means so much more. It is                                     who we are and what we believe best prepares students for success in today's rapidly                                     changing world.
