https://cdsp.edu	p			“Christians today have to invent practices of ministry that meet the world on its own terms with a distinct voice,” says President and Dean W. Mark Richardson. “But invention can only succeed over time if it is borne out of deep and faithful grounding in the Christian tradition. CDSP helps students become the inventors of the church of tomorrow. ” To find out more, watch our video, or come and visit.

https://cdsp.edu	h2			The CDSP Distinction
https://cdsp.edu	p			The only Episcopal seminary on the West Coast, CDSP forms leaders called to find new ways to create Christian communities and share God’s love. Through a recently announced partnership with Trinity Church Wall Street and an ongoing dialog with bishops and grassroots leaders, we have focused our degree programs on Christian mission, discipleship, and evangelism and on core leadership skills of contextual awareness, critical reflection, and public conversation; established a popular low-residency degree option for students balancing family obligations or professional responsibilities, and established partnerships that allow us to create distance learning curricula for individual dioceses.

https://cdsp.edu/apply	h2	h2		Frequently Asked Questions
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			Is the GRE required for admission to the Master of Divinity program?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		No. The GRE is not required for admission. If you have GRE scores, you are welcome to include them in your application packet.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			Is the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) required for admission to other programs?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		The GRE is only required for the GTU Common MA and Doctoral programs. It is not required for the Master of Divinity and Master of Theological Studies programs. The CDSP Admissions Committee evaluates all parts of the application equally when making admissions decisions. The scores are not an exclusive factor in the admissions process, but are balanced with other parts of the application (essays, interviews, transcripts and references).
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			Is an undergraduate degree required for admission?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		Yes. We do not admit students without undergraduate degrees except in rare occasions.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			Can I transfer credit from current or previous university work?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong	br	Yes, in some cases. Coursework to be credited toward a CDSP program must be completed on the graduate level and cannot have been counted toward another completed academic program. For instance, if you completed an MA, coursework used to fulfill requirements for that cannot be applied to another degree program. If you did not complete the MA, then transfer credit may be an option.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		Transfer credit situations are unique, so it is a good idea to discuss your plans to transfer coursework well ahead of beginning study at CDSP. To do so, please contact the Admissions Office at 510-204-0738 to discuss your situation.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			What’s the Graduate Theological Union (GTU), and how does it work?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong	a	The 
https://cdsp.edu/apply	a			GTU
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong	br	 is an internationally-known consortium of eight Bay Area seminaries and various affiliates, located in or near Berkeley. Together, the consortium offers over 750 courses to its students each year, and access to the expertise of around 126 faculty members and scholars. CDSP students frequently enroll in courses offered by other GTU schools. The GTU provides the opportunity for students to simultaneously obtain a solid grounding in their own tradition while broadening their horizons within an ecumenical setting. This allows for and invites a diverse and rewarding seminary experience.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		All students share the GTU library (one of the top four theological libraries in the country), containing more than 400,000 volumes of books and other works. In addition, students have lending privileges at the University of California, Berkeley libraries and Stanford University collections.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			What is a typical course load for a full-time student?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		Full-time students typically enroll in four, three-unit courses per semester.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			Can I attend part-time? How long does it take to complete a degree/program?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong	a	CDSP’s degree and certificate programs may be pursued on a full-time or part-time basis and in low-residence and online formats. Call (510) 204-0738 or 
https://cdsp.edu/apply	a			email 
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		the Admissions Office to learn more.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			Do I have to be an Episcopalian or Anglican to enroll at CDSP?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		No. Although many of our students are Episcopalians, others come from a variety of faith and cultural backgrounds.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			Is CDSP only for people who want to be priests?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		No. Theological education is for everyone. Although many of our students enter seminary with the intention of pursuing ordination, we have certificate and masters programs, and online courses options, for lay people pursuing theological education for personal and professional reasons.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			What does CDSP do to encourage diversity?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong	br	CDSP strives to be welcoming to students regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexuality, political convictions, physical ability, and age. We are on a continuing journey to learn how best to do this, and how the community can become transformed by encounters with each other.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	strong		CDSP has welcomed students from many different backgrounds, including African-American, Native American, Hispanic, Chinese, Korean, Indian and Filipino. We can also accommodate students with physical disabilities. The gender ratio is about half female and half male, but that varies from year to year. CDSP does not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, religion, color, ethnic or national origin, gender, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, medical condition, veteran status, or age.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	h2	div		Visiting the Campus and Interviewing
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			How do I arrange a campus visit?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	h2		CDSP welcomes visitors, and encourages everyone to visit a few classes, worship, share a meal, and join us in fellowship and student life. Free lodging is usually provided at either our guest house or a nearby hotel, and meals are provided free of charge in our refectory.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	p		Typical visits begin with a friendly greeting and chat with one of our Admissions team. This is followed by a campus tour, classroom visits, worship, lunch or dinner in the refectory, and other fellowship opportunities.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	p		We particularly encourage visiting on Thursday for Community Night. Community Night is an informal get-together with students, staff, faculty and their families, and usually includes music and other fun activities. It’s a great chance to get to know us, and to experience student life in an informal atmosphere. .
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	p	a	To arrange a visit or to find out more about 
https://cdsp.edu/apply	a			See CDSP
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	p	a	, please contact the Admissions Office 
https://cdsp.edu/apply	a			via email
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	p		 or by phone at 510-204-0738.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	strong			Are interviews required for admission?
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	p		Interviews are required for all MDiv and MTS applicants. Interviews are encouraged for all certificate applicants. While most interviews are held on-campus, online interviews can also be arranged under special circumstances.
https://cdsp.edu/apply	p	p		There are two interviews: one by a faculty member and one by the Dean of Students. Interviews consist of questions about academic and emotional readiness, vocational/study interests, and any special questions you have regarding seminary life.

https://cdsp.edu/ma	li	li		Produce research projects, each with a clearly formulated thesis  statement that is supported by appropriate evidence from primary and  secondary sources communicated in an effective scholarly presentation.

http://cdsp.edu	h2			Why CDSP?
http://cdsp.edu	p			“Christians today have to invent practices of ministry that meet the world on its own terms with a distinct voice,” says President and Dean W. Mark Richardson. “But invention can only succeed over time if it is borne out of deep and faithful grounding in the Christian tradition. CDSP helps students become the inventors of the church of tomorrow. ” To find out more, watch our video, or come and visit.

http://cdsp.edu	h2			The CDSP Distinction
http://cdsp.edu	p			The only Episcopal seminary on the West Coast, CDSP forms leaders called to find new ways to create Christian communities and share God’s love. Through a recently announced partnership with Trinity Church Wall Street and an ongoing dialog with bishops and grassroots leaders, we have focused our degree programs on Christian mission, discipleship, and evangelism and on core leadership skills of contextual awareness, critical reflection, and public conversation; established a popular low-residency degree option for students balancing family obligations or professional responsibilities, and established partnerships that allow us to create distance learning curricula for individual dioceses.
