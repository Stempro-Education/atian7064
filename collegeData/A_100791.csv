http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	h1			General Admissions Requirements
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	h2			Your Future Has Many Possibilities.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	p			Make the right choice and let Purdue Global help you achieve your educational and career goals.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	h2			Requirements
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	span			General Admissions Requirements
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	p			You must complete an Enrollment Agreement and all required documents and submit monies as outlined on the Tuition and Fees Schedule. The Enrollment Agreement must be signed by a parent or legal guardian if you are younger than 18 years of age.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			You may be required to complete an informational interview.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			All courses are taught in English. You must be able to speak, read, and write English fluently. English abilities will be determined through the University's interview, application process, and placement exam.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			You must complete financial arrangements prior to starting class. If applicable, financial aid applications must be completed.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li		a	All first-term students at Purdue Global are considered conditionally admitted to the University and will not be fully admitted to their program until all documents required for admission are received and approved. Students are not eligible for Title IV federal financial aid while in this conditional admission status. Students continuing in a conditional admission status past the end of the Purdue Global Commitment period may be subject to tuition and fees charges. See the 
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	a			Purdue Global Catalog
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li		br	 for details on documentation requirements and the Purdue Global Commitment.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			Nondegree-seeking students enrolled in graduate programs will be considered fully accepted at enrollment rather than conditionally admitted. Students returning to the University are considered fully accepted at enrollment.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	span			Program and State Admissions Requirements
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			All applicants must complete any programmatic admissions requirements, if applicable. Contact an Admissions Advisor for specific requirements.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			For nursing programs, documentation of any required health examinations, tests, and immunizations must be presented prior to registering for clinical courses or an externship experience. Health science programs may require health examinations, including pathology tests and immunization records, to be administered no earlier than 12 months prior to the end date of the externship. Documentation must be submitted prior to registering for clinical courses or an externship. Nursing and health science programs may require additional documentation as necessary to comply with specific federal and/or state requirements for student nurse candidates and health science profession candidates. Contact an Admissions Advisor for information on the specific documentation required for the program of your choice, as well as timeframes for submitting this documentation.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			The state and various other agencies may require criminal background checks before you can be placed in an externship or take professional licensing, certification, or registration exams. If you have prior felony convictions, you may be denied the opportunity to take professional licensing, certification, or registration exams, or may be denied a license or certification to practice in some states even if the exam is taken and successfully completed. You are responsible for inquiring about current requirements prior to enrolling in the program of your choice.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			Some programs require documentation that need not be submitted at the time of admission, but is required for successful completion of the program. If you attended high school in a foreign country, additional documentation may be required.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	span			International Admissions Requirements
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			Purdue Global is authorized under federal law to enroll nonimmigrant, alien students. International students who wish to be admitted to any Purdue Global for-credit program must be 18 years or older, and must complete admissions requirements and provide evidence of adequate financial resources. To ensure that international students are prepared to complete college-level coursework, they must demonstrate a command of oral and written English skills. 
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			Transcripts from foreign institutions must meet the same requirements as domestic institutions and must be translated and evaluated by an approved foreign credential evaluator prior to enrollment. The University does not guarantee the transferability of credits from other educational institutions.

http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			By the last day of the first term, you must provide the University with an official copy of the transcript. If an official transcript is not submitted by this time, you will be withdrawn from the University, blocked from reentry, and your academic credentials will be withheld until such documentation is provided.

Acceptable attestation may be the proof of graduation attestation included on the Enrollment Agreement, the FAFSA, or any other document deemed acceptable by the University.
http://www.kaplanuniversity.edu/admissions/general-requirements	li			Prior to starting an academic program or being conditionally admitted, you may be required to take an entrance examination. A minimum score may be required to begin an academic program or to be conditionally admitted to the University. If you fail to meet the minimum score, you may not be admitted to the University or may be required to take foundational coursework. Contact an Admissions Advisor for details on which programs require the test and what constitutes a passing score.
