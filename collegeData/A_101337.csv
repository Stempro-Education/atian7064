http://richmont.edu	a			History
http://richmont.edu	a			Counseling
http://richmont.edu	a			Ministry
http://richmont.edu	p			Richmont’s legacy of excellence began in 1933 when the Chattanooga Bible Institute (CBI) was founded to support local churches and their various ministries. In 2000 CBI merged Psychological Studies Institute (PSI), a well known Atlanta instution that was founded in 1973. The combined institution became accredited by SACSCOC and was renamed Richmont Graduate University
http://richmont.edu	p			Today, Richmont is a fast-growing, faith-based graduate school providing master's-level training in counseling, ministry, and spiritual formation. With thriving campuses in Atlanta, Georgia and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
http://richmont.edu	a			 Richmont Graduate University is authorized for operation as a postsecondary educational institution by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission.
http://richmont.edu	p		a	In order to view detailed job placement and graduation information on the programs offered by Richmont Graduate University, please visit 
http://richmont.edu	a			 https://www.tn.gov/thec/bureaus/student-aid-and-compliance/postsecondary-state-authorization/authorized-institutions-and-data.html 
http://richmont.edu	p			Counseling - Richmont seeks to attract students who have a heartfelt desire to integrate psychological principles and Christian faith. We anticipate graduates of the Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling program to pursue licensure as a mental health professional and become employed in a church agency or the private sector. 
http://richmont.edu	p			Those in ministry engage culture and people deeply when they can do three things: one, wisely interpret Scripture; two, demonstrate how theology addresses the great questions that people have; and three, are at ease with, and are supported by, their own theological identities.
http://richmont.edu	p			We have not just created another academic degree.  We have laid out pathways of growth so that your passion to become all you are called to be in the world will be nurtured, guided and expanded.  Both significance and longevity will be added to your calling.
