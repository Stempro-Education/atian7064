http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	li			Admission to the CCP program does not guarantee that a student will be able to enroll                            in any given course since the university has a primary obligation to first serve the                            needs of the university’s degree-seeking students.                         
http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	li			Unless previously approved by the course instructor and the registrar, no more than                            15 percent of the students in any course section shall be CCP students.                         
http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	li			Students are responsible for consulting with their high school guidance counselor                            to determine if and how courses completed through CCP will be granted as credit toward                            high school graduation requirements.

Option A students must                            attend the orientation session held on Bluffton’s campus in August prior to course                            registration. Option B students must attend the orientation session in September that                            is scheduled through their local high school.                         
http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	li			Students in CCP will be limited to 30 college credit hours per academic year. Students                            can earn a maximum of 120 college credit hours while in the program.                         
http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	li			The high school guidance counselor will monitor the total number of credit hours a                            student takes.                         
http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	em			Registration will be based on a first-come, first-served basis, determined by the                               date of application submission.
http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	li			The registrar’s office will annually compile a list of courses for which accepted                            CCP students will be allowed to register, based on space availability. Course selection                            will be limited each semester.                         
http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	li			CCP students must return textbooks and any software on the last day of exams for each                            semester. Grades will not be released until textbooks and software are returned. (This                            does not apply to students continuing in classes that require the same textbook the                            next semester.)                         
http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	li			Failure to pass, complete or properly drop a course for reasons other than those accepted                            by the student’s school district may result in any or all financial obligation for                            the course defaulting to the student or the student’s parent.                         
http://www.bluffton.edu/admissions/apply/ccp	li			If you enroll at Bluffton University after high school graduation, the credit earned                            will be applied toward graduation requirements.
