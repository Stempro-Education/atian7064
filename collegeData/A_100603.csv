http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			How does the University support my son/daughter's academic success?
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			The Center for Academic Excellence, located on the fourth floor of the Library, is                staffed by a team of professionals dedicated to helping students achieve academic                success at Franklin Pierce University. Study skills workshops, essential skills instruction,                tutoring and the development of reading skills and learning strategies are among the                many services offered. The Center for Academic Excellence assists students who have                documented learning differences, by helping students learn what services are available                to them and by working with faculty to provide necessary accommodations.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			Who will be my son's or daughter's academic advisor?
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			Their First-Year Seminar professor will serve as the student's initial academic advisor.                This advisor will work with the student until he or she chooses an academic major                and faculty advisor within his or her major.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			What if my son or daughter misses a week or more of classes due to a personal or medical                emergency?             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			In the case of a personal or medical emergency that causes a student to miss classes                for a week or more, the student or his/her representative should contact the Office                of the Dean of Academic Affairs at (603) 899-4280, which will inform the professors.                The student is responsible for making up any assignments missed and should contact                the professors upon return.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			How can my son or daughter receive help with writing papers and essays?
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			The Peter C. Wensberg Writing Center serves all members of the campus community as                a resource for writing needs and concerns. Administered through the Humanities Division                and English Department, the Wensberg Writing Center is staffed by Faculty and Peer                Tutors who are trained to help a student produce the best writing that he/she can.                Any member of the campus community may use the Wensberg Writing Center and should                feel free to come at any time during the writing process. Whether the goal is to develop                ideas, create an outline or evaluate some written work, the staff will meet with the                client regardless of where they are in the writing process. While the Wensberg Writing                Center serves as a useful resource for a student who identifies him/herself as a weak                writer, we also assist students who identify themselves as strong writers.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p		a	For all clients, we provide the services of a trained reader and responder, a tutor                who may be able to help the client to produce more effective writing. The Wensberg                Writing Center (WWC) is located in the Center for Academic Excellence. Tutoring sessions                generally last 30 minutes, but may go longer at the discretion of the tutor. Please                call (603) 899-4107 or visit the

Monies may be added and inquiries about the account balance may be made at                any time. Cash may not be taken from the Raven Card; any remaining credit will be                carried over to the next year.

http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			When do I pay my son's or daughter's tuition bill?
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			Fall tuition bills will be emailed to your students FPU email account starting in May                and are due by June 1.

http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			What happens if my son or daughter earns a private scholarship after financial aid                has been awarded?             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			If a student receives a scholarship after he or she has been awarded financial aid,                the student must contact Student Financial Services.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			Are the student's personal belongings covered by the University's insurance if they                are lost, stolen, or damaged?             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			The University will not accept responsibility for damage to, loss of, or theft of                personal belongings. Students are encouraged to carry insurance through their parents'                homeowner's policy or other carrier.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			Are there on-campus jobs available to students?
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			Employment is awarded to many students who demonstrate financial need. As part of                a financial aid package, a student may be awarded Federal Work Study. Upon arrival                on campus, a student with an award in Federal Work Study begins looking for a job                by consulting the online jobs board. A student applies directly to the on-campus employer.                Most jobs pay the minimum wage. Typically, students work eight to twelve hours a week.                Students are paid every two weeks by direct deposit into the student's checking account.                Other questions may be directed to the Human Resources Office at (603) 899-4075.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			Why isn't my son's or daughter's Work Study (student employment) award deducted from                his or her bill?             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			Federal Work Study awards must be earned during the academic year, thus, they cannot                be deducted from the bill.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			What if my financial situation changes during the year?

http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			What is the Outreach Education Center and what kind of services do they provide?
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			Outreach Education is the counseling component of Franklin Pierce University located                in the lower level of Granite Hall across the court yard from Residential Life. We                share the entryway with Health Services but are a separate University entity. Outreach                is staffed by the Rob Koch, Director of Outreach Education and Counseling, and Dr.                Patricia Moore, Coordinator of the Women's Crisis Center; both are well prepared and                qualified to meet the needs of the Franklin Pierce student community. In addition,                graduate student interns are also available to assist our students.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			We are generalists in regard to the many issues which may arise at Franklin Pierce,                but we each also have particular expertise in certain therapeutic areas. For instance, Patricia's                specialties include women's issues, substance abuse and addiction, and learning disabilities.                Rob is a Creative Arts therapist who handles men's issues, substance abuse, learning                disabilities, and special needs.              
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			Outreach Education works closely with Academic Services, Residential Life, Campus                Ministries, and the Health Center to meet the academic and therapeutic needs of the                community. Anyone in the Franklin Pierce community including staff, faculty, or students                can make referrals to Outreach. All information and/or referrals made to Outreach                are held in strict confidence and are not shared with anyone without the written permission                of the student, including outside agencies or authorities. The outreach counselors                and therapists are all ethically and legally bound to protect the confidentiality                of the students.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			If a student enters Franklin Pierce with previous connections with outside therapists,                we will, with signed student permission, contact that professional to insure a smooth                transition from home to the University environment. Outreach will also refer students                to outside area agencies as needs arise.

http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			Encourage Student Involvement
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			With a variety of clubs, classes, intramurals, athletics, student leadership and community                service opportunities, every student is able to find a place for his or herself. Sometimes                all it takes is a little encouragement from parents for a student to find his/her                niche.             
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	h6			I already pay my child's tuition. Why should I also donate to Franklin Pierce?
http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	p			A gift to Franklin Pierce University is used to advance educational programs, improve                facilities, enhance cultural and recreational activities, and provide financial aid                for students. Since tuition and fees only cover approximately 70% of the cost to educate                a student at Franklin Pierce, the University must rely on its alumni, parents, faculty,                staff and friends to make up the difference in unrestricted gifts to the Parents Fund.                The gifts Franklin Pierce receives from generous donors helps keep tuition costs reasonable,                provide much-needed scholarships, and they enhance the quality of the educational                experience our students receive.

http://www.franklinpierce.edu/admissions/parents.htm	span		a	Every philanthropic gift to Franklin Pierce, a nonprofit university, is a conscious                   choice to help change the lives of young women and men. Franklin Pierce has been a                   place of opportunity and new beginnings for students for more than five decades. The                   generosity of alumni, parents, friends, faculty, staff, corporations and foundations                   ensures that Franklin Pierce can fulfill its promise to our students today, while                   securing the future for those who will follow. There are many ways to support Franklin                   Pierce. Thank you for your support.
