The O’Connor Honors Program is a binding program tailored for applicants with high academic credentials — applicants must have an LSAT score of at least 165 and a cumulative undergraduate GPA of at least 3.81 as calculated by LSAC.
https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	p			Admitted applicants will be designated “O’Connor Fellows” and will enjoy the following benefits:

Admission and scholarship decisions are made on a rolling basis, therefore, for best consideration, applicants should make every effort to apply when the ASU Law application is available beginning 
https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	strong			August 15, 2019
https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	p			. Applications received after the March 1, 2020, priority deadline will be accepted but considered late.

https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	h2			       ASU Achievement Program    
https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	p			The ASU Achievement Program allows applicants who meet certain criteria to apply to the JD program without taking the LSAT. In general, the applicant must have earned or will earn a bachelor's degree from ASU within a particular time frame or be applying as a joint degree candidate. If you are interested in applying to the ASU Achievement Program, please contact our office prior to applying or registering with LSAC.
https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	p			In order to be eligible for this program, the applicant must satisfy all requirements listed below:

https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	p			Any Achievement applicants with a valid LSAT score on file with the LSAC or who register for the LSAT will have their application and/or offer of admission withdrawn. *Any joint degree applicant admitted to the JD program (under (b) above) who does not also earn admission to the other graduate program for joint enrollment will have their admission to ASU Law rescinded.
https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	h3			Review Process
https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	p	h3		Review of applications for admission and scholarship are done on a rolling basis, therefore applicants are encouraged to apply as early in the admissions cycle as possible. The admissions committee will begin reviewing applications as they are marked complete. The admissions committee aims to return decisions within 15 business days from the date the application is marked complete. However, the admissions decision timeframe may increase as we approach the priority application deadline of March 1st.
https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	p	p		Applicants are responsible for ensuring that all required documents are received by our office. Applicants will typically receive a confirmation email and instructions on accessing the application status checker within 3 business days of submitting the electronic application.
https://law.asu.edu/admission/apply/jd	p	p		Be aware that during the application review process the admissions committee may request additional information to be provided.

https://students.asu.edu/apply	h3			Frequently asked questions about applying to ASU
https://students.asu.edu/apply	p			Why should I use the Common Application to apply for admission?
https://students.asu.edu/apply	p	strong		If you are applying to multiple universities, you might consider using the Common Application because it enables you to apply to several universities at once. The Common Application uses the information you enter to automatically complete the applications of all the schools you wish to apply to. (Note that not all schools you wish to apply to may be part of the Common Application.) ASU has no preference as to whether you use the Common Application or the ASU Admission Application to apply to ASU, but you should apply using only one.
https://students.asu.edu/apply	p			How can I check my application status?
https://students.asu.edu/apply	p	strong	a	You can check your application status on My ASU. If you are concerned about the status of your application, you may also 
https://students.asu.edu/apply	a			contact your admission representative
https://students.asu.edu/apply	p			Can I defer my admission?
https://students.asu.edu/apply	p	strong	a	Yes, you may 
https://students.asu.edu/apply	a			defer your admission
https://students.asu.edu/apply	p	strong		 for up to five terms, or two-and-a-half years. It is important to note that if you decide to defer your admission, the deferment applies only to university admission and not necessarily admission to your major or program of study. If you defer your admission, you must contact Admission Services.

http://campus.asu.edu/polytechnic	h3			A nexus for studies featuring opportunities for project-based learning within advanced laboratory spaces.
http://campus.asu.edu/polytechnic	p			The ASU Polytechnic campus is a nexus for studies in interdisciplinary sciences, engineering, management, technology and education. Industry partnerships are key to the campus’ distinctive course offerings, which provide opportunities for project-based learning within advanced laboratory spaces. Specialized equipment for hands-on exploration includes simulators for flight and centers for consumer behavior research, semiconductor fabrication, comprehensive commercial printing and design services, and on-demand digital manufacturing. 
http://campus.asu.edu/polytechnic	p			The expansive Polytechnic campus incorporates a major regional airport yet maintains the ambiance of a small, self-contained community by offering family housing, a freshman residence hall, dining facilities and a student recreation center. 
http://campus.asu.edu/polytechnic	p			A desert arboretum reserves a peaceful native space devoted to sustainability, preservation and contemplation. Within a 30-minute drive of the campus are hiking and recreational opportunities amid the legendary Superstition Mountains, with small and large lakes nearby.
