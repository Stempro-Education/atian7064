https://www.artinstitutes.edu/care	p			The MIU community recently took on an amazing community-minded opportunity to work with Miami’s Homeless Trust organization on a project called, Roofs Rising where 1,100 miniature wooden houses were painted to raise awareness of homelessness in Miami. The 1,100 houses represent the actual number of beds needed to house Miami’s street homeless. The final, painted houses were used in an art installation in the form of one large house. Students from our visual arts program along with some staff took on painting 200 houses of the 1,100 that were completed.

https://www.artinstitutes.edu/care	p			Tammy Wascovich, an instructor at The Art Institute of Dallas, a branch of Miami International University of Art & Design, was this year’s Decoration Committee Coordinator for the 2018 Kidney Cancer Coalition’s Rock the Cure event. Wascovich enlisted the help of Ai Dallas Audio Production instructor Doug Holmes and Barb Pennington, Assistant to the President, to each paint a guitar made from plywood. The decorated guitars were used as centerpieces on the tables and subsequently sold during the banquet’s auction to support fundraising efforts. All proceeds from the event and auction were used to fund the research of the UT Southwestern Kidney Cancer Program.

College Bound courses are non-credit bearing and do not transfer into our academic program offerings or the offerings of any other institution. However as part of the course you will have the opportunity to develop a portfolio that you are able to request proficiency credit. Proficiency credit is awarded based on the proficiency credit policy defined in an institution’s academic catalog. The cost of the College Bound courses varies between $325 and $350. This cost is waived for any student that has an application and completed essay on file with the school. Check with the school you are interested in attending for exceptions and details, as not all programs are offered at all locations. Individual location participation is subject to change. Online College Bound courses are not available to residents of the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Oregon.
