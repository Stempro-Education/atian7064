https://www.trevecca.edu/admissions/visit	h2			Visit our campus and enjoy Trevecca’s southern hospitality, its vibrant city, and welcoming community. Come see for yourself why Trevecca is such a great place to call home.
https://www.trevecca.edu/admissions/visit	p			Trevecca’s campus is surrounded by beautiful and exciting Nashville, Tennessee. Known as the “Athens of the South” and “Music City USA,” the city of Nashville is home to 20 institutions of higher education, so “college life” in Nashville really describes a large part of the city. Trevecca students enjoy the small community feel of the campus along with opportunities that only a large city can offer—internships in major corporations, an outstanding arts community, sports and music venues, and much more. Trevecca has much to offer students who want to attend a smaller university where they can be part of campus life and still be part of a large metropolitan area. Trevecca’s beautiful campus is approximately one mile from the heart of downtown Nashville. We hope you will visit us and our city soon.

http://www.trevecca.edu/admissions/visit	h2			Visit our campus and enjoy Trevecca’s southern hospitality, its vibrant city, and welcoming community. Come see for yourself why Trevecca is such a great place to call home.
http://www.trevecca.edu/admissions/visit	p			Trevecca’s campus is surrounded by beautiful and exciting Nashville, Tennessee. Known as the “Athens of the South” and “Music City USA,” the city of Nashville is home to 20 institutions of higher education, so “college life” in Nashville really describes a large part of the city. Trevecca students enjoy the small community feel of the campus along with opportunities that only a large city can offer—internships in major corporations, an outstanding arts community, sports and music venues, and much more. Trevecca has much to offer students who want to attend a smaller university where they can be part of campus life and still be part of a large metropolitan area. Trevecca’s beautiful campus is approximately one mile from the heart of downtown Nashville. We hope you will visit us and our city soon.
