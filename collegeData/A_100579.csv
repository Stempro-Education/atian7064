https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Academic Requirements: Graduates of an Accredited High School
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	div		ol	 For unconditional admission, the applicant who will enter Florida College as the graduate of an accredited high school must meet the following minimal academic requirements: 
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li		ul	Complete at least 16 high school academic units, including: 
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Four units in English (with courses including substantial study of grammar, composition, or literature)
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Two units in social sciences (courses such as American, world, or state history, civics, geography)
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Three units in mathematics (algebra I, algebra II, geometry, or higher level courses),
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Two units in college preparatory natural sciences (biology, chemistry, or physical science courses with laboratory components)
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			 Additional academic units may include such courses as economics, psychology, sociology, humanities, and foreign languages.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Graduate with at least a 2.00 grade point average (on a four-point scale)
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li		a	Provide standardized test scores (ACT or SAT) required for appropriate course placement (as explained in the course placement section below). More information on how to send scores can be found on our 
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Sending Test Scores
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li		ul	 page.Note regarding which scores are accepted: 
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Florida College accepts the standard ACT test. If you choose to take the writing portion for your own purposes, your score for this section will not be evaluated by Florida College or included to determine your composite score for academic scholarships or course placement.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Florida College accepts the SAT1 test. However, we do not utilize the writing portion of the exam for academic scholarships or for course placement purposes. We will only evaluate the critical reading and the math scores of this exam.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Academic Requirements: Home-Schooled Students
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	div		br	 For unconditional admission, the applicant who will enter Florida College as the graduate of a home-school program must be at least 17 years old by the date of registration and must meet the above academic requirements for graduates of an accredited high school. 
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			TOEFL Scores: International Students
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			In order to be admitted to Florida College the student must score at least 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language—213 on computer-based (CBT), 79-80 on internet-based (IBT) – or must attain ELS level of 112.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Conditional Admission
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			A student who meets the age and character requirements but has not fulfilled all the academic requirements for unconditional admission may be admitted conditionally if he or she:
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			has graduated either from an accredited high school or a home-school program, but has not completed the 16 academic units required for unconditional admission; or
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li	li		has completed at least one year of high school and makes acceptable scores on the General Education Development (GED) examination.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	ul		The student admitted conditionally may remove the condition before enrolling in Florida College by completing high school or college courses in the subject areas of the deficiencies. Otherwise, the student must begin during the first semester of enrollment to remove deficiencies by completing Florida College courses in those subject areas. One semester of college work completed successfully (with a grade of C or better) will substitute for one year of high school study in the same subject area.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Probationary Admission
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			A student may appeal to be admitted on probation if his or her grade point average in high school or college work completed elsewhere is less than a 2.00.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		The written appeal should be directed through the admissions office to the academic dean and the academic standards committee, at whose discretion students may be granted probationary admission. The appeal should include additional academic references, support letters, scores on standardized tests, an explanation of mitigating circumstances and a statement indicating the student’s motivation and commitment. The committee bases admission decisions on its judgment of a student’s potential for academic success. Students admitted on probation must achieve at least a 1.60 grade point average on a full time load of at least 12 semester hours to have their probationary status lifted; those not successful in removing the probation during the first semester will be suspended for one semester. For further information about academic probation, see the catalog index and the student handbook.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Credit by Examination
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Up to 30 semester hours credit may be earned by examination. No examination credit can be assigned if credit by course work is previously or subsequently awarded, or if a course in that discipline or any part thereof has been begun in college classroom work.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			International Baccalaureate
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Florida College will accept 30 semester hours for the International Baccalaureate Diploma.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Advanced Placement
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			The College Board provides several college level advanced placement programs in courses comparable to those offered at Florida College. Florida College will grant three credit hours for a score of 3, and six credit hours for a score of 4 or 5 toward graduation. Florida College will accept scores on AP exams in ENG LANG/COMP or ENG LIT/COMP for credit in ENC 1101 and ENC 1102 (Freshman English).
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			College Level Examination Program
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Florida College will grant credit for the following scores:
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			A score of 50 or greater on the Freshman College Composition with Essay Examination. Florida College will not accept the English Composition Examination without Essay. (ENC 1101, 3 semester hours)

https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li	li		A score of 50 on the Language Examination. (4 semester hours, Elementary level)
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Transfer Students
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			A student in good standing at another institution who is eligible to return to that institution may apply to enter Florida College as a transfer student. Prospective transfer students should complete all the steps in applying for admission.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		Transfer applicants should have a grade point average of at least 2.00 on previous college-level work. Students whose grade point average is below 2.00 may appeal for probationary admission with a letter addressed to the academic dean (mailed to the admissions office). The letter should explain any mitigating circumstances that affected the GPA; it should also express the applicant’s motivation and commitment. The academic dean will notify the applicant of the admission decision.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		Transfer students must provide official transcripts from all colleges they have attended. Failure to report previously attempted college-level work constitutes a falsification of application and may cause a student to be suspended and to lose all Florida College credit.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		Application materials should reach the office of admissions by Aug. 1 for fall enrollment and Dec. 1 for spring enrollment. Applicants who fail to meet the deadline incur a $100.00 late fee.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Transfer Credit
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Florida College accepts credits from regionally accredited colleges and universities. The A.A. degree from such institutions is accepted as block credit. When transfer credit is considered course by course, no grade below “C” is accepted. The registrar, with the help of the academic dean, evaluates transcripts to determine what credits will be accepted and what credit will be granted for courses not parallel with those offered by Florida College.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		The College does not award credit for basic military training, Defense Activities for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) or life or work experiences. Credit for military courses and training may be granted on the basis of a formal evaluation by the registrar and credit recommendations in the American Council on Education (ACE) guide.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Transient Student Admission Requirements
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Transient or “visiting” students are those who are currently working toward a degree at another university or college and would like to take courses at Florida College and have the credits transferred back to their home institution. This status is ideal for students who are home for the summer or who are looking to get ahead or catch up on the degree program at their home institution.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Transient Student Affidavit
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	div	strong	Individuals who wish to enroll as a transient student must submit an admission application, application fee, photo, a letter of good standing from the home institution or a transcript from the home institution, and submit the 
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	strong			transient student affidavit
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	div		. A transient student must not be on suspension or probation from their home institution. Admittance requires good academic standing from the home institution. Transient students are not eligible for financial aid.
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p	a	Transient students may enroll in up to six hours per semester and are limited to enrollment in two consecutive semesters at Florida College. Transient students are permitted to enroll on a space-available basis. Transient students must agree to abide by the 
https://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Florida College Code of Conduct

http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Unconditional Admission
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Academic Requirements: Graduates of an Accredited High School
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	div		ol	 For unconditional admission, the applicant who will enter Florida College as the graduate of an accredited high school must meet the following minimal academic requirements: 
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li		ul	Complete at least 16 high school academic units, including: 
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Four units in English (with courses including substantial study of grammar, composition, or literature)
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Two units in social sciences (courses such as American, world, or state history, civics, geography)
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Three units in mathematics (algebra I, algebra II, geometry, or higher level courses),
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Two units in college preparatory natural sciences (biology, chemistry, or physical science courses with laboratory components)
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			 Additional academic units may include such courses as economics, psychology, sociology, humanities, and foreign languages.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Graduate with at least a 2.00 grade point average (on a four-point scale)
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li		a	Provide standardized test scores (ACT or SAT) required for appropriate course placement (as explained in the course placement section below). More information on how to send scores can be found on our 
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Sending Test Scores
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li		ul	 page.Note regarding which scores are accepted: 
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Florida College accepts the standard ACT test. If you choose to take the writing portion for your own purposes, your score for this section will not be evaluated by Florida College or included to determine your composite score for academic scholarships or course placement.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			Florida College accepts the SAT1 test. However, we do not utilize the writing portion of the exam for academic scholarships or for course placement purposes. We will only evaluate the critical reading and the math scores of this exam.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	strong			Academic Requirements: Home-Schooled Students
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	div		br	 For unconditional admission, the applicant who will enter Florida College as the graduate of a home-school program must be at least 17 years old by the date of registration and must meet the above academic requirements for graduates of an accredited high school. 
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			TOEFL Scores: International Students
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			In order to be admitted to Florida College the student must score at least 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language—213 on computer-based (CBT), 79-80 on internet-based (IBT) – or must attain ELS level of 112.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Conditional Admission
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			A student who meets the age and character requirements but has not fulfilled all the academic requirements for unconditional admission may be admitted conditionally if he or she:
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			has graduated either from an accredited high school or a home-school program, but has not completed the 16 academic units required for unconditional admission; or
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li	li		has completed at least one year of high school and makes acceptable scores on the General Education Development (GED) examination.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	ul		The student admitted conditionally may remove the condition before enrolling in Florida College by completing high school or college courses in the subject areas of the deficiencies. Otherwise, the student must begin during the first semester of enrollment to remove deficiencies by completing Florida College courses in those subject areas. One semester of college work completed successfully (with a grade of C or better) will substitute for one year of high school study in the same subject area.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Probationary Admission
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			A student may appeal to be admitted on probation if his or her grade point average in high school or college work completed elsewhere is less than a 2.00.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		The written appeal should be directed through the admissions office to the academic dean and the academic standards committee, at whose discretion students may be granted probationary admission. The appeal should include additional academic references, support letters, scores on standardized tests, an explanation of mitigating circumstances and a statement indicating the student’s motivation and commitment. The committee bases admission decisions on its judgment of a student’s potential for academic success. Students admitted on probation must achieve at least a 1.60 grade point average on a full time load of at least 12 semester hours to have their probationary status lifted; those not successful in removing the probation during the first semester will be suspended for one semester. For further information about academic probation, see the catalog index and the student handbook.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Credit by Examination
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Up to 30 semester hours credit may be earned by examination. No examination credit can be assigned if credit by course work is previously or subsequently awarded, or if a course in that discipline or any part thereof has been begun in college classroom work.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			International Baccalaureate
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Florida College will accept 30 semester hours for the International Baccalaureate Diploma.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Advanced Placement
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			The College Board provides several college level advanced placement programs in courses comparable to those offered at Florida College. Florida College will grant three credit hours for a score of 3, and six credit hours for a score of 4 or 5 toward graduation. Florida College will accept scores on AP exams in ENG LANG/COMP or ENG LIT/COMP for credit in ENC 1101 and ENC 1102 (Freshman English).
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			College Level Examination Program
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Florida College will grant credit for the following scores:
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li			A score of 50 or greater on the Freshman College Composition with Essay Examination. Florida College will not accept the English Composition Examination without Essay. (ENC 1101, 3 semester hours)
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li	li		A score of 50 or greater on the College Mathematics examination. (MGF 1107, 3 semester hours)

http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	li	li		A score of 50 on the Language Examination. (4 semester hours, Elementary level)
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Transfer Students
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			A student in good standing at another institution who is eligible to return to that institution may apply to enter Florida College as a transfer student. Prospective transfer students should complete all the steps in applying for admission.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		Transfer applicants should have a grade point average of at least 2.00 on previous college-level work. Students whose grade point average is below 2.00 may appeal for probationary admission with a letter addressed to the academic dean (mailed to the admissions office). The letter should explain any mitigating circumstances that affected the GPA; it should also express the applicant’s motivation and commitment. The academic dean will notify the applicant of the admission decision.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		Transfer students must provide official transcripts from all colleges they have attended. Failure to report previously attempted college-level work constitutes a falsification of application and may cause a student to be suspended and to lose all Florida College credit.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		Application materials should reach the office of admissions by Aug. 1 for fall enrollment and Dec. 1 for spring enrollment. Applicants who fail to meet the deadline incur a $100.00 late fee.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Transfer Credit
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Florida College accepts credits from regionally accredited colleges and universities. The A.A. degree from such institutions is accepted as block credit. When transfer credit is considered course by course, no grade below “C” is accepted. The registrar, with the help of the academic dean, evaluates transcripts to determine what credits will be accepted and what credit will be granted for courses not parallel with those offered by Florida College.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p		The College does not award credit for basic military training, Defense Activities for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) or life or work experiences. Credit for military courses and training may be granted on the basis of a formal evaluation by the registrar and credit recommendations in the American Council on Education (ACE) guide.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Transient Student Admission Requirements
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			Transient or “visiting” students are those who are currently working toward a degree at another university or college and would like to take courses at Florida College and have the credits transferred back to their home institution. This status is ideal for students who are home for the summer or who are looking to get ahead or catch up on the degree program at their home institution.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Transient Student Affidavit
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	div	strong	Individuals who wish to enroll as a transient student must submit an admission application, application fee, photo, a letter of good standing from the home institution or a transcript from the home institution, and submit the 
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	strong			transient student affidavit
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	div		. A transient student must not be on suspension or probation from their home institution. Admittance requires good academic standing from the home institution. Transient students are not eligible for financial aid.
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	p	p	a	Transient students may enroll in up to six hours per semester and are limited to enrollment in two consecutive semesters at Florida College. Transient students are permitted to enroll on a space-available basis. Transient students must agree to abide by the 
http://www.floridacollege.edu/admissions/apply	a			Florida College Code of Conduct
