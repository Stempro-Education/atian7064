A hard worker who wants to start a career in just weeks                               through accelerated certification. A student who needs flexible classes—with convenient                               locations close to home and work, and at times that fit your schedule.                             
http://valenciacollege.edu/admissions	p			If you have a high school or GED diploma, you’re accepted at Valencia College. To                               be admitted, just submit your admissions application and official academic transcript(s)                               to the Admissions and Records Office. Don’t have your high school or GED diploma?                               You may still be admitted as a provisional non-degree-seeking student.
