http://www.msun.edu/admissions	h1			Welcome to MSU-Northern!
http://www.msun.edu/admissions	p		br	At Northern, we know that value is about more than the sticker price - and you want                               to buy more than a fancy piece of paper.
http://www.msun.edu/admissions	p		br	Northern's value is our comprehensive programming, successful students, and partnerships                               with employers and the community.  Our graduates go on to earn 50% more a year after                               graduation than graduates of all four-year colleges in Montana. We care about more                               than classes and homework; we also want you to have FUN!
http://www.msun.edu/admissions	p		br	Our activities include on-campus concerts and comedian performances, intramural sports,                               open gyms, disc golf, and dances.  We also have our own bowling alley and fitness                               center at the Student Union Building, and numerous other campus activities that make                               college life enjoyable!
http://www.msun.edu/admissions	p		br	The campus is a 20-minute drive from trails, fishing, hiking and camping in America's                               largest county park, Hill County's Beaver Creek Park. Havre is just 30 miles from                               the Canadian border. That proximity allows for a flow of culture and access to many                               nearby attractions. Affectionately referred to as the Crown Jewel of the Continent,                               Glacier National Park is a 3-hour drive from campus.
