http://lyndonstate.edu/admissions-and-aid/applying-nvu/financial-aid	h2			North is Affordable.
http://lyndonstate.edu/admissions-and-aid/applying-nvu/financial-aid	p			North is opportunity. Hard work. Commitment. It's also an investment.
http://lyndonstate.edu/admissions-and-aid/applying-nvu/financial-aid	p			At Northern Vermont University, we understand that college is a significant expense for families. But if you want to make an impact on your future, you'll need to make an investment now. We're here to help guide you through the process of paying for college. Our student financial services experts on both campuses can answer your questions and help you navigate the path to paying for your college degree.
http://lyndonstate.edu/admissions-and-aid/applying-nvu/financial-aid	p			NVU offers scholarships for full-time students enrolling for the first time or transferring. Vermont residents, who already benefit from our affordable in-state tuition, can reduce the cost of attendance with merit scholarships that reward academic achievement. Out-of-state students residing in our Good Neighbor and Regional Student Program/NEBHE areas can combine those tuition discounts with merit scholarships. Find out details about merit scholarships and regional and family tuition discounts for Vermonters and out-of-state students here.
