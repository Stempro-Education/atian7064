https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	a			Online Studies & Graduate School                    
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			When are classes offered?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			All online degree program classes and graduate program classes are offered completely online, one course at a time. You may log on whenever you choose to complete your courses throughout the week. Each course is between 7-14 weeks in duration. This allows you to quickly earn your degree.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			What credits can I transfer in?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Undergraduate college credits, obtained from a regionally or nationally accredited institution, can potentially transfer, if a “C” or higher was earned. Graduate credits, from a regionally accredited college, can potentially transfer with a grade of “B” or higher, if taken within the last 10 years. Students must take at least 24-30 credits at Crown to obtain a degree from the institution. Our enrollment staff would be glad to look at your transcripts and give you a tentative evaluation and timeframe to complete your degree.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			How long will it take to get a degree?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			With no previous college experience, an associate’s degree takes three years to complete and a bachelor’s degree would take two additional years to complete. Any transfer credits can greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to earn your degree. For instance, if you have already earned an associate’s degree, or an equivalent number of credits from various colleges, it will likely take only two years to complete your bachelor’s degree. Graduate degrees are designed to take approximately two years to complete. We do accept transfer credits into the graduate programs.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			How much study time is involved?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			The general guide, for every enrolled credit hour, is 1-2 hours of homework. A survey was conducted of our 600 adult students and the average time spent studying is eight hours per week.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			What things do I need to do to get accepted?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			For the complete list of required items, visit our Steps to Enroll page. You may also contact the Crown School of Online Studies and Graduate School office for program specific requirements at 952-446-4300 or 1-800-910-GRAD (4723).
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			When can I start?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Prior to the start of your first course, you will be required to complete a self-paced online orientation. For your convenience, we also offer periodic live interactive online orientations.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			When do I pay for class?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Payment is required by the first day of the semester. Students have the option to pay their bill in full or set up a payment plan with the Student Billing Office. This payment plan divides your bill into three equal payments that are due the first three months of the semester. Accepted payment includes credit card, cash and/or financial aid. You can either pay online or at orientation.

https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			What is the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford Loans?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			A subsidized loan is based on financial need. The federal government will pay the interest on a subsidized loan through your enrollment period in school and through the grace period. An unsubsidized loan is not based on financial need. You must either pay the interest monthly/quarterly, or have the interest capitalized (added to the principal loan amount). Repayment of the interest and principal begins six months after you graduate, leave school or drop below half-time enrollment.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Should I be paying my interest on an unsubsidized student loan while in school?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			If you can pay the interest while in school, you will repay less in the long run. If you choose to capitalize the interest (having the interest added to the principal amount of the loan), you will increase the total amount you must pay back after you graduate or drop below half-time enrollment.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Do I have to borrow the entire amount of loan on my Award Letter?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			No, borrow only what you need to meet your educational costs.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			What if I borrow the loan and later on find out I don’t need the loan?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			You can repay your loan to your lender at any time, without penalty. Contact the Financial Aid Office if you want to cancel all or part of the loan during the school year.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			If I do not want to borrow an educational loan at this time, is there another option for financing my college costs?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p		a	Yes, you may want to consider Tuition Management Systems. For more information about this payment plan, go to

https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	a			Information Technology (IT)                    
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Bringing a Computer
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Below are some recommendations to consider when choosing a computer to bring to campus:
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			The Information Technology department will provide limited telephone-based technical support to students with personal computers in the residence halls. However, support can only be offered if the computer meets the minimum specifications listed below. We may be able to provide support for operating systems other than those listed, but the department officially supports only those listed.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Students are responsible to provide a network cable to connect their computer to the network port in their residence hall. These cables are available from many local stores, in addition to being sold in the Crown College bookstore. Our wireless network does extend to cover residence halls, so a wired connection is not required.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			In a large residential network, antivirus software is now a necessity. Viruses can spread quickly between computers in the residential network. All students will be required to own and maintain a working antivirus program on their computers.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Minimum specifications: The minimum requirements for your computer operating system are Windows 7 or newer for PCs, or Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or newer for Apple computers.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li		ul	If you have an older operating system and are considering upgrading: 
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Crown College does not provide assistance upgrading personal computers. If you do not have the ability to upgrade, we recommend seeking assistance from a trusted friend, or to purchase the upgrade service in a retail setting.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			For Windows, Microsoft provides tools to check if your system is compatible with the newer versions. (Windows 7, Windows 8)
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li		a	If you decide to upgrade, you can find Microsoft Windows software for Crown students at a discounted price at 
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	a			www.crown.edu/msoffice
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			We recommend using Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome to access Crown’s web services.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li		a	You will need Microsoft Office 2010 or newer for Windows computers, or 2011 or newer for Apple computers. Microsoft Office software is available for Crown students at a discounted price at 
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Email Accounts
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Every student at Crown is given an email account. The username and password is issued to each student when they register for courses. The email address for each student is structured as follows:
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			[last name][first initial][middle initial][entrance year]@students.crown.edu
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Example: If a given student’s name is George John Doe and their entrance year is 2010, then the email address would be doegj10@students.crown.edu.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Software Provided by Crown
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Crown College licenses a number of software applications for use by our students. Some are available only while a current student, others are licensed in such a way that after graduating from Crown College, the license becomes perpetual and the student is allowed to retain the program indefinitely.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Microsoft Office Professional: The full version of Microsoft Office Professional is licensed for student use. Both the PC and Mac editions are covered by this license. Students are allowed to install one copy of the program on their own computer. If a student is leasing a laptop from the Technology Services department, that laptop will be pre-installed with the most recent version of Microsoft Office Professional. This application suite includes Microsoft Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint and Publisher (depending on the version of the suite).
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Upon graduation, Microsoft grants us permission to print a perpetual license agreement for graduates of Crown College, giving permission to continue using the software after leaving the College.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Internet Access
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Crown provides high-speed access to the Internet. The Internet is available from any part of the Crown College network — from dorms, labs, classrooms and offices, as well as over the wireless network where it is available. Because a large community must share this connection, some restrictions must be instated to maintain the usefulness of the connection:
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is strongly discouraged. The downloading of copyrighted materials (such as music and movies) without permission is theft and Crown College does not condone or accept such activities. Peer-to-peer networking also tends to severely tax the networks it runs over. To prevent problems, the IT department regulates the types of traffic that travels through our Internet link and peer-to-peer network traffic is severely limited.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Crown College utilizes a product to monitor and filter access to pornographic and adult-content sites. The pornography industry is thriving in the new Internet economy. Often, adult sites are disguised to trap Internet users who inadvertently click on a seemingly innocuous link or mistype a URL. The filtering product protects our community from these adult-industry tricks. Crown College recognizes that pornography can also be a dangerous trap. The filter provides a measure of accountability, as well, by logging Internet activity.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Streaming audio and video can be very bandwidth intensive. We ask that students be courteous and mindful of the fact that the Crown College Internet connection is a shared resource and therefore to make responsible use of these technologies.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Wireless Network
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Our campus-wide wireless network now covers the main building and all residence halls. Personal wireless routers are prohibited, as they interfere with the college’s system. The wireless network is comprised of a large quantity of 802.11g wireless access points arranged around the campus. Any computer equipped with a wireless network card capable of communicating using the 802.11b or 802.11g standards (including 802.11n devices, which function on the 802.11g system) will be able to connect to the wireless network.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Public Access Printers
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			A number of printers are available for student use on campus. The computer labs are equipped with high-capacity, black-and-white networked laser printer for student use at a very low cost. The 3rd floor lab printer is also capable of doing high quality color prints. See the printing policy for more information.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Network File Storage
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Crown maintains a file server for student use. This server is accessible from anywhere on campus. Each student is granted 100MB of storage on the server. Use of this network drive is strongly recommended as it allows for easy access to documents and information from virtually anywhere on campus. Data on the student server is also backed up nightly, preventing accidental loss of information.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Help Desk
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p		a	Current students, staff or faculty with technology issues can contact the Help Desk at

Academic advisors will help you put together a course schedule and academic plan.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			What does it mean to be a full-time student?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			A full-time student takes at least 12 credits per semester. If you drop a course, withdraw from a course, or do not pass a course, and you fall below 12 credits during a semester, you are not considered a full time student during that semester. Athletes must have 12 credits to be eligible for varsity athletic participation.

https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	a			Nursing Department/BSN-Prelicensure                    
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Does the Nursing Department require students to purchase a laptop?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			All nursing students are required to own a laptop/notebook computer, effective August 1, 2008. Students should contact Financial Aid to discuss this cost being a part of their financial aid package at Crown. Due to the need for computers in the classroom, a desktop computer is not sufficient for on-campus students. The following are minimum specifications for the laptop:
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Less than 4-years old at the time of admission to Crown College
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			DVD-ROM
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Wireless card
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Sound card
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Microsoft Office 2003 or 2007 (may purchase from Crown at student rate; all files must be in MS2003)
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Windows XP or newer
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	li			Macintosh/Apple (OS X/10.2 or higher) is allowed but students must be able to read/write Windows-ready documents or files.

https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Are students required to have high-speed internet at home?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			No. However, most students do not tend to spend long hours working in the campus computer lab. Dial-up will work for most things, but students spend a lot of time online in the nursing program.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Can I play sports or do other extracurricular activities and be in the nursing program?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Maybe. The nursing program is very difficult and demanding from a content and time perspective. The other issue is that students will not be excused from clinical or lab activities for extracurricular activities or events.

https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			When should I apply to Crown College?

You will be working with the college, as well as financial institutions, your country’s embassy, the U.S. Embassy or Consulate and the U.S. Department of Immigration and Naturalization Services.

https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			What kind of financial assistance does Crown College offer to international students?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			International students are responsible for funding their Crown education. Funds for a full year must be documented before an I-20 allowing entrance into the United States will be issued. A certified bank letter or statement from the student’s family or sponsor must be provided before an I-20 document can be issued. This bank letter should verify an amount equal to or exceeding $19,900 USD. To assist international students in financing their education, Crown College provides an International Student Grant in the amount of $4,000 USD per year. Students are also eligible for additional scholarships and grants.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p			Although federal law prohibits international students from working off campus, Crown College offers international students the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 USD per year for on-campus employment to assist in the cost of attendance. If work is available, international students may work up to 15-hours per week while classes are in session and up to 40 hours per week during breaks and throughout the summer. All students are responsible for securing their own work position on campus and are paid directly by check. Crown cannot guarantee on-campus employment for international students.
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			What financial documentation does Crown College require for international students?
https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	p		a	United States immigration laws require us to verify the ability of international students to pay all tuition and living expenses for the time they are studying in the US. Financial verification must be made prior to institutional issuance of a Certificate of Eligibility (Form I-20 or DS-2019). Information on this verification can be found on the Application for International Undergraduate Admission. Visit the

https://www.crown.edu/admissions/faqs	h3			Does Crown have an English proficiency requirement for international students?
