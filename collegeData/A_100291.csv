http://www.cwu.edu	span			Description
http://www.cwu.edu	p			One fifth of the population is affected by disability, and laws protect their rights as individuals to have access. To be accessible, an environment—work, home, school, shopping, medical, leisure, and virtual/digital—must be functional for everyone. Central's accessibility studies program provides opportunities to learn about barriers that exclude people with disabilities. Moreover, it serves to ensure that every environment will accommodate everyone, regardless of ability.
http://www.cwu.edu	span			Opportunities
http://www.cwu.edu	p			Starting fall 2017 students can earn a minor or a certificate online in accessibility studies. A fast-track certificate is also offered over the summer. At CWU, almost 30 pre-professional degrees across disciplines—from business and information technology, to social services and safety and health management—have added the accessibility minor as an option to broaden their student’s employment opportunities.
http://www.cwu.edu	span			Why this program?
http://www.cwu.edu	p			CWU's program is the first in the country dedicated to increasing accessibility by applying universal design principles to all fields of study and careers.

http://www.cwu.edu	a			Business
http://www.cwu.edu	p			Accounting is about providing reliable economic data to decision makers. And there are a number of career paths available to accounting majors ranging from working for a corporation or business to crunching numbers for a government agency or non-profit organization.
http://www.cwu.edu	p			The largest major within the College of Business gives students a broad business education, allowing them to grasp the broad business spectrum, and to communicate with accountants in other specializations and non-accountants too.
http://www.cwu.edu	p			The program is led by an Accounting Advisory Council, comprised of industry leaders, who assist in shaping and linking it to top-flight regional and national organizations.
