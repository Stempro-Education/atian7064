http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/faq	a			What is the application deadline?
http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/faq	div		a	                              The UC application is only available online on the 
http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/faq	a			University of California website
http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/faq	div			. Students can access the application starting on August 1 and then submit their applications November 1-30. There is an application fee of $70 per UC campus or $80 for international students per UC campus. There are fee waivers available for individuals who meet a certain criteria. Please check with your high school's college counselor for more information.                          
http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/faq	a			What is the required minimum GPA and SAT/ACT for admission?
http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/faq	div			                              We do not hold freshman applicants to a specific minimum test score. Freshman applicants must have at least a 3.0 GPA for California residents or a 3.4 GPA for non-residents, and there is no minimum required score for the SAT or ACT Plus Writing. Applicants with lower GPAs should aim for a higher than average test scores. We accept either the SAT with Essay or ACT with Writing for admission eligibility, and we do not have a preference between exams. The deadline to take this exam is December of the student's senior year.

AP and IB courses are also weighted.                          
http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/faq	a			Is there a visit day for prospective students?
