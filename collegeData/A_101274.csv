http://www.pcom.edu/admissions/apply/odl.html	li			Official transcript(s) of all undergraduate and graduate course work

http://www.pcom.edu/admissions/apply/odl.html	h2			 Admissions Process 
http://www.pcom.edu/admissions/apply/odl.html	h6			What happens after I apply?
http://www.pcom.edu/admissions/apply/odl.html	p			The Admissions Committee screens applications, invites some applicants for an interview, evaluates the applicants and selects new students. Following the completion of the admissions process, each applicant is notified in writing of the Admissions Committee decision, including any conditions that must be satisfied prior to or following enrollment. 
http://www.pcom.edu/admissions/apply/odl.html	p			The Program director may evaluate a student's life/work experience for credit after a student has been accepted into the program. 
http://www.pcom.edu/admissions/apply/odl.html	p			The program utilizes a rolling admissions policy, so applications will be considered throughout the year as they are received. Students will be accepted into the program until the desired class size is achieved, therefore it is recommended for candidates to submit applications early. Students are accepted and enrolled for each term (summer, fall, winter and spring). 
http://www.pcom.edu/admissions/apply/odl.html	p			As an applicant to PCOM's graduate programs, you are responsible for ensuring that all admissions materials are completed accurately and submitted in a timely manner. 
http://www.pcom.edu/admissions/apply/odl.html	h6			Background check requirement
http://www.pcom.edu/admissions/apply/odl.html	p			In an effort to foster the safety and well-being of the entire campus communities, as well as to ensure that students accepted to PCOM will be permitted to perform clerkships/internships required to successfully complete their degree requirements, PCOM requires all first-year students to complete a criminal background check prior to matriculation. All students must have their criminal background checks processed through a PCOM vendor of choice. The Admissions Office will send notification of the process after confirmation of enrollment and must have this information on file prior to orientation; students will not be allowed to start classes without this information.
