https://www.coe.edu/admission	a			 Coe
https://www.coe.edu/admission	h1			Admission
https://www.coe.edu/admission	p			There’s never been a better time to be a Kohawk. Coe College is ranked among the top 20 percent of all colleges and universities in the United States.
https://www.coe.edu/admission	p		a	Our location in the heart of the 
https://www.coe.edu/admission	a			Cedar Rapids, Iowa
https://www.coe.edu/admission	p		a	 provides students with access to over 
https://www.coe.edu/admission	a			one thousand internships
https://www.coe.edu/admission	p			 and jobs. Cedar Rapids boasts the lowest unemployment rate of any city in the nation for college graduates. Because of the superb networking and internship opportunities we provide, The Princeton Review recently named Coe one of the nation’s Top 25 Best Schools for Internships. In fact, 100% of students are guaranteed an internship, research project or off-campus study experience.
https://www.coe.edu/admission	p			Our low student-to-faculty ratio means students have access to accomplished, knowledgeable professors who are interested in their success. Coe faculty members routinely use their connections to help students land jobs and acceptance into top graduate programs.
https://www.coe.edu/admission	p			With nearly 100% of reporting graduates employed or in graduate school a year after graduation, the results speak for themselves.

https://www.coe.edu/admission/parents	p			In many cases, what is important to a student's college decision is also important to his or her parent. At Coe College, we consider the entire family to be vital members in the college education process.
https://www.coe.edu/admission/parents	p			Sending your child to a college, whether it is in your backyard or several hundred miles away, can be a nerve-racking process. What should I focus on? How do I know what school is best for my child? Will they be successful? Will they be happy? Most importantly, will they be prepared for the world upon graduation? Because these are all important questions, Coe makes it a top priority to address each family's individual concerns.
https://www.coe.edu/admission/parents	p		br	Overall, the best thing a parent can do is ask questions and support their son or daughter in their search. After researching Coe, you will realize that students here are happy; they do succeed; they are most definitely prepared. The world is their playground and each Coe student is encouraged to aim high and is given the necessary tools to live a successful life. Your student is in good hands. Feel free to relax!
