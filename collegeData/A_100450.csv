http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	h2			Application FAQ
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Do you require the SAT or ACT?
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Yes, Bachelor of Music applicants must take the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT I), and submit their scores. Curtis only accepts the SAT, not the ACT.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			How much does the application process cost?
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			There is a nonrefundable application fee of $150 U.S. Payment is required to complete the online form. There is an additional $100 screening fee for the following departments:
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	li			Horn
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Does Curtis have a wait list?
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			This depends on the department and the year. If there are a number of highly qualified applicants, and not the same number of open spots, then there may be a wait list.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Can I double-major at Curtis?
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Yes, but you must audition separately for each major department and must be admitted by each faculty.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Can I send in a recording and be accepted?
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			All applicants must audition in person. Video recordings will not be considered in place of a live audition, except as noted in screened departments. Applicants to the composition department have original compositions examined by the department and a finalists interview in Philadelphia.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Are there any age limits?
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Curtis sets no minimum or maximum age for the admission of exceptional students to most of its programs. Students younger than college age are considered candidates for the Curtis Diploma. These students pursue their musical studies at Curtis and their college-preparatory academic studies at an accredited public or private middle or high school of their own choosing. They may opt to transition to the Bachelor of Music program when they reach college age. Students who already have a bachelor’s degree when they enter Curtis may pursue graduate-level work toward a post-baccalaureate Diploma or a Master of Music in Opera.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			How difficult is it to get into Curtis?
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Curtis’s application process is similar to that of other music schools, consisting of two steps: 1. Complete the Acceptd application online; 2. Audition. The acceptance rate varies from year to year and across programs, but overall has remained steady at about 4 percent. Don’t let this discourage you. Many of our current students didn’t believe they could be accepted, but auditioned anyway. They are now thriving at Curtis.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			What does Curtis look for in an audition?
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			Ultimately, the most important factor is artistic promise. Though showing technical proficiency in the audition is a requirement, the strongest candidates for admission demonstrate an inherent musical gift that shows the potential to develop into an exceptional artist.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			What is the typical Curtis student like?
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply	p			A typical Curtis student shows outstanding technique and musicality, along with openness to critiques and an eagerness to learn. The Curtis community is a tight-knit, supportive family. A collegial atmosphere prevails, and contributes to Curtis’s nurturing environment. Curtis students focus on their craft and positively engage with and learn from their peers, faculty, and the world around them.

http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	h3			Frequently Asked Questions
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	a			                         What are the basic requirements for the Bachelor of Music program?                     
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	p			Curtis requires both:
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	li			A recognized high school diploma
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	li			An SAT score of 500 in the Critical Reasoning section
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	p			Curtis also reviews the score of the SAT written exam for placement. Math scores or other SAT advanced tests are not required.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	p			For non-native English speakers, Curtis requires the SAT and one of the following TOEFL scores:
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	li			The TOEFL written score minimum of 550, or
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	li			213 on the computer-based TOEFL test, or
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	li			A post-2005 Internet TOEFL iBT of 79-80
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	a			                         If I don’t have a 500 on the SAT, does that mean I cannot get into the Bachelor of Music program?                     
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	p			In reviewing requests for entry into the Bachelor of Music program, Curtis takes into account all facets of a student’s academic record—especially high-school grades and graduation, standing in all Curtis classes, and SAT and other standardized test scores. Students with strong academic records should meet with the chair of the liberal arts program for a review of their potential. The chair will then meet with the dean to make a final decision.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	a			                         How should I prepare for the SAT? Should I sign up for an SAT prep course?                     
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	p			The most important thing is not that a student study for the SAT, but that he or she try to become as comfortable and proficient as possible with the English language and American culture by reading books and magazines, speaking English, watching movies, and so on. SAT prep programs are expensive, are usually not geared for non-English speakers, and may take away valuable time from your other work. We do recommend that you purchase an SAT prep book from a bookstore. There are also practice tests online. The College Board's SAT Preparation Booklet is available from the associate dean of student services, free of charge.
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	a			                         I can’t afford to pay for the prep materials. Can Curtis help me?                     
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	p		a	If cost is a concern, feel free to connect with our director of student financial assistance, 
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	a			Veronica McAuley
http://www.curtis.edu/admissions/apply/international	p			. If you have financial need, Curtis can help with the purchase of these materials. Be sure to have an estimate of the cost for the material you want to buy.
