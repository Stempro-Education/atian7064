https://ccuniversity.edu	h2			Cincinnati Christian University Announces Historic RELATIONSHIP
https://ccuniversity.edu	p		br	From: Cincinnati Christian University Board of Trustees
https://ccuniversity.edu	p			Date: October 28, 2019
https://ccuniversity.edu	p	p		Cincinnati Christian University (CCU) announces a new relationship with Central Christian College of the Bible (CCCB). This follows the decision by CCU’s Trustees to withdraw from Higher Learning Commission accreditation following the Fall 2019 semester.  In Spring 2020, CCCB will open an extension site in Cincinnati to provide accredited ministerial degrees in the region. At the same time, CCU will work together with CCCB to serve more congregations and ministry leaders through the Center for Church Leadership (CCL).
https://ccuniversity.edu	p	p		CCU realizes this decision will greatly impact students and employees, but also views it as the best possible stewardship of the resources and opportunities God has provided. Over the past two decades, it has become increasingly difficult to provide accredited ministry programs at a reasonable cost in a metropolitan location. CCU has approached this challenge by exploring mergers, adding other programs, and expanding athletic programming to attract more students. These strategies have allowed the school to serve new populations but have not overcome the financial challenges that face many private, residential colleges today.
https://ccuniversity.edu	p	p	br	CCU will assist CCCB in establishing an extension site in the Cincinnati tri-state area for current and future ministry students to receive undergraduate and graduate education. CCU will also assist students enrolled in other degree programs with transfer options to other schools.
https://ccuniversity.edu	p	p		Central Christian College of the Bible was chosen by CCU’s Trustees because of its longstanding compatibility with CCU’s purpose to “equip and train men and women for Christian service.” CCCB is located in Moberly, Missouri, is affiliated with the Christian Church movement, and is accredited nationally by the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE) to offer on-site and online degrees.
https://ccuniversity.edu	p	p		This collaboration will ensure that quality ministry programs are available in the Cincinnati tri-state area while allowing CCU to focus on ministry support services for churches and their leaders through the Center for Church Leadership. The CCL currently serves over 800 congregations nationwide, is led by its own staff and Advisory Council, and collaborates with leading Restoration Movement churches and organizations. In 2020, the CCL will launch major new initiatives in congregational consulting, clergy search, and directory services, and hopes to include over 2000 churches in its network by 2021.
https://ccuniversity.edu	p	p	i	Chris Hahn, Chairman of CCU’s Trustees, said 
https://ccuniversity.edu	i			“This uniting of forces to gain ground for the future of the church does my heart good.  I’m excited for our current and future students.”
https://ccuniversity.edu	p	p	i	  Dr. Fincher said, 
https://ccuniversity.edu	i		sup	“Our team will be working hard in the next several months to serve CCU’s current students, work together with the CCL, and build a collaborative model of Christian higher education for ministry training in the 21
https://ccuniversity.edu	i			 Century.”
