http://www.westminstercollege.edu	p	h4		Jimmy Black (MBA ’10) began his MBA at Westminster College in 2008. Unsure of what path he wanted to pursue, Jimmy participated in Master Track as part of his MBA experience. It was through his work with his mentor and Master Track cohort that he was able to figure out what he really loved and wanted to do with his professional life. He knew that his passions were college football and fashion, specifically at Nike.
