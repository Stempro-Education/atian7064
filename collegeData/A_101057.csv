http://www.moravian.edu/admission-all	p			It’s a bold concept—we know, but remember what we said about being revolutionary? A private college education should be accessible and affordable for everyone, whether you’re pursuing your first bachelor's degree, third masters, or just taking classes for fun. That’s why we award more than $40 million in college-funded financial aid each year, provide fellowship and scholarship resources, and work with local employers to provide graduate program discounts.

http://www.moravian.edu/apply	strong			Credit by Examination
http://www.moravian.edu/apply	p		br	Moravian College recognizes the concept of “course equivalency,” which permits the College to certify the educational value of private study and other out-of-class experiences and, following appropriate evaluation by the College, enables the student to receive academic credit toward a degree. Some ways by which students may receive advanced placement and credit by examination are detailed in the following tables. A maximum of 8 course units for credit by examination, in any combination, may be applied to a Moravian College degree.
