https://www.nwic.edu	h3	i		What Students Say
https://www.nwic.edu	p			My educational and career goal was to research ways to improve the Alaska Native Village waste disposal by working closely with other governmental entities and health organizations, to make informed decisions, positive local actions, and useful inquiries that lead to improved community health. Upon completion with my Bachelors of Science at Northwest Indian College, Zender Environmental Health and Research Group was awarded an Environmental Justice Grant in December 2018 from EPA to develop a pilot 2 for Backhaul Alaska to test further for the cost and logistics to remove hazardous waste from rural communities, which I am working on as a Grant Manager and Environmental Scientist.

https://www.nwic.edu	span	span		BSNES alumnus
https://www.nwic.edu	p			As an adult, I transferred to Northwest Indian College to study about Indigenous cultures of the Pacific Northwest and more specifically about my community’s culture. I feel that being a student at NWIC has afforded me an opportunity to learn from and with like-minded students.

https://www.nwic.edu	span	span		TGBM Student
https://www.nwic.edu	p			I enjoy going to NWIC because of the support and opportunities that are available. For me, attending a tribal college was what was best for me. It has provided me with opportunities to network in the native community, and get the degree I want. Being part of a tribal college is important and beneficial because it allows natives, like myself, to be educated  while embracing who we are as a native people.
