https://www.trident.edu/faq	div		i	 What financial aid programs are offered at Trident?
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div		"We participate in federal student financial aid programs that are authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (""Title IV Financial Aid programs""). Specifically, we participate in the Federal Pell Grant Program, the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (""Direct Loan Program""), the Federal Direct PLUS Loan program, and the Direct PLUS Loans for Graduate and Professional Degree Students Program. Trident disburses financial aid in two equal disbursements over the academic year/loan period. We do not offer scholarships at this time. However, we will accept your scholarship(s) from other sources."
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div		i	 What lenders are available for federal student loans?
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div		Beginning with the 2010-2011 school year (July 1, 2010), the primary federal student loan program will be the Direct Loan Program. The United States government is the lender for all Direct Loans.
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div		i	 Will federal financial aid cover ALL of my tuition expenses?
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div		Even if you are eligible for federal student financial aid, such aid MAY NOT cover ALL of your tuition and other education-related expenses. You may need to seek to supplement your federal student financial aid by applying for veteran's education assistance, military tuition assistance (TA), or sources of aid for which you may be eligible, in order to help defray costs of attendance.
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div		i	 What is the Enrollment Agreement and Disclosure (EAD)?
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div	a	The EAD is an agreement between you and Trident, through which you accept responsibility for paying any and all tuition and fees in connection with your enrollment and attendance if your financial aid is unable to be awarded and/or disbursed. Signing an EAD postpones payments on your tuition until your federal financial aid funds arrive, if you remain eligible. If you have any questions about the EAD as it relates to tuition charges and payments please contact the Bursar's Office at 
https://www.trident.edu/faq	a			bursar@trident.edu
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div		i	 What things should I know about the federal title IV financial aid process?
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div	ul	The Student Finance Department cannot award federal financial aid to an eligible student until the student has been admitted to degree program and has completed required documents. The FAFSA, Trident financial aid application, and any required verification documents enables Trident to develop a financial aid package based on your eligibility for federal financial aid and expected contributions from other sources. Trident encourages students to utilize the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data retrieval tool when completing the FAFSA. The information provided on the application is compared to other documents presented to the Financial Aid Advisor. It is imperative that students submit all documentation timely and provide accurate information or corrections may need to be submitted to the Department of Education for processing and may delay the awarding and disbursement of federal financial aid funds.    Receiving an award letter verifies a student's Title IV grant will be processed and/or Title IV loans will be certified. If you need assistance in understanding your award letter, please refer to the sample award letters below:  
https://www.trident.edu/faq	a			Undergraduate Sample Award Letter
https://www.trident.edu/faq	a			Graduate Sample Award Letter
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div		  Note that funds will not be received until it is determined the student is meeting satisfactory academic progress and module 1 has been completed. In addition to those requirements, if a student is a first-time federal student loan borrower, the loan funds will not disburse until the student has been in attendance for 30 days. Students who are receiving federal student loan funds (not Pell Grants) will receive an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Notification via email from the Bursar's Office when loan funds are received notifying them of the loan amount disbursed and other pertinent information.
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div		i	 What is Verification?
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div	ul	The U.S. Department of Education ‘ED’ may select your file for a process known as ‘verification.’ If you are selected for verification, the Trident financial aid application will prompt you with a request for additional information and/or documentation and ask you to confirm data reported on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Verification documentation must be received prior to awarding and disbursing of any aid.    Also, Trident must verify any information it has reason to believe is incorrect on any application. At its discretion, Trident may require a student to verify any FAFSA information and to provide any reasonable documentation in accordance with consistently applied school policies. In either situation Trident may, but is not required to, include any of the 2016–2017 CPS verification items not already included.    Verification documentation may include, but is not limited to, the following:

https://www.trident.edu/faq	div		i	 How will I receive my disbursement?
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div	strong	After the completion and approval of your Federal Title IV Financial Aid application and official admission to the University, you will receive an award letter for the academic year if you are eligible for aid. Trident will release the amount awarded to you in two equal disbursements; the first disbursement during at the beginning of the academic year (first session) and the second disbursement after half of the academic year is completed (third session if satisfactory academic progress is met). The first disbursement should be received within 10 days after completion of your first module in the first session, unless you are a first-time borrower in which the loan funds will not be disbursed until you have been in attendance for 30 days. Trident will apply the disbursement amount to your student account to cover any tuition owed to the University. If your financial need was greater than tuition, the disbursement amount may exceed the tuition owed to the University creating a credit balance on your student account. Depending on what you have directed the University to do with the funds, Trident will hold any excess amount in your student account to cover future tuition costs, return the excess to the lender, or refund the excess to you. If you selected to have the credit balance sent directly to you, the Bursar will mail the check to you within 14 days from the date the funds are credited to your student account, per requirements of the Department of Education.    The second disbursement is subject to your ability to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). To remain eligible for federal student financial aid, among other requirements, you must maintain SAP. If SAP is met, the second disbursement will be received within 10 days after completion of module 1 in the 3rd session of your academic year. Trident will apply the disbursement amount to your student account to cover any tuition owed to the University. If your financial need was greater than tuition, the disbursement amount may exceed the tuition owed to the University creating a credit balance on your student account. Depending on what you have directed the University to do with the funds, Trident will hold any excess amount in your student account to cover future tuition costs, return the excess to the lender, or refund the excess to you. If you selected to have the credit balance sent directly to you, the Bursar will mail the check to you within 14 days from the date the funds are credited to your student account, per requirements of the Department of Education.    When applying for Federal Title IV Financial Aid within SSS, you will be asked to read and electronically accept the University's SAP policies. Your original award letter assumes you will maintain SAP. However, if over the course of the first disbursement period you have not maintained SAP, your second disbursement will be delayed and you may lose eligibility to receive the aid. The delay will occur regardless of what your original award letter and/ or communications with your lender may have indicated.    Please be sure you have read the University's policies on SAP and understand them. If you have any questions, please contact the Student Finance department for clarification.    
https://www.trident.edu/faq	strong			Out of Pocket Costs
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div		  The Federal Title IV Financial Aid offered to a student in the award letter may not be enough to cover tuition.    Students have an obligation to pay Trident any tuition not covered by Federal Financial Aid or other sources. Students may contact the University Bursar for payment information on tuition balances.
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div		i	 When will I receive my Federal Pell Grant refund if I am eligible for a Pell Grant?
https://www.trident.edu/faq	div	div		Pell Grants are available only to bachelors degree students who do not already have a baccalaureate or first professional degree.    Trident will release the amount awarded to you in two equal disbursements; the first disbursement during at the beginning of the academic year (first session) and the second disbursement after half of the academic year is completed (third session if satisfactory academic progress is met). The first disbursement should be received within 10 days after completion of your first module in the first session. Trident will apply the disbursement amount to your student account to cover any tuition owed to the University. If your financial need was greater than tuition, the disbursement amount may exceed the tuition owed to the University creating a credit balance on your student account.
