https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/checklist	strong			Personal Statement

https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/checklist	strong			LSAT
https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/checklist	p		a	—All applicants must take the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT).

https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/checklist	p		strong	—The Law Center requires its applicants to subscribe to the Credential Assembly Service (CAS).

https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/requirements	p			Although the undergraduate GPA and LSAT score(s) are typically the most important factors relied on by the admissions committee in determining an applicant’s admissibility, other factors may play an important role in admissions decisions as well. Therefore, the admissions committee encourages applicants to submit other information that would be of assistance in evaluating the applicant’s aptitude for the study of law and likely contribution to the academic and community life of the Law Center. A small sampling of such factors might illustrate the applicant’s:
https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/requirements	li			Academic performance and accomplishments;
https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/requirements	li			Evidence of significant leadership and/or public service;
https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/requirements	li			Professional and/or military service; and,
https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/requirements	li			Cultural and/or experiential background.
https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/requirements	p			A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university is required for admission.
https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/requirements	p			Applicants must have good moral character. Good moral character includes honesty, trustworthiness, and other traits relating to the role of a lawyer in society and the legal system. Admission is contingent on the accuracy of information received. Failure to fully disclose information may result in the revocation of an admissions offer or in disciplinary action by the Law Center or bar disciplinary authorities. Admission to the Louisiana State Bar has similar requirements. Different states may require character and fitness investigations prior to admission to the State Bar. Please contact the appropriate State Bar for information.
https://www.law.lsu.edu/admissions/apply/requirements	p			An applicant whose native language is not English is required to submit a score of at least 600 on the paper-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), 250 on the computer-based TOEFL or 100 on the internet-based TOEFL. This is a test designed to evaluate proficiency in English and is administered at testing centers overseas and throughout the United States. Information regarding this test may be obtained by writing to TOEFL, Education Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey, 08541.
