http://www.vinu.edu/web/admissions/apply	p		a	Vincennes University and Ivy Tech Community College have announced a new partnership, which began with the fall 2018 semester. This collaboration will provide a seamless, cost-effective degree pathway for students in high-demand, high-value careers. It starts with students completing their first two years and earning an associate degree with Ivy Tech Community College, then culminates in earning a Vincennes University bachelor’s degree in Homeland Security and Public Safety the two years following (for full-time students). This partnership offers flexibility to students by allowing them to choose to take courses at Ivy Tech Indianapolis, online, or a combination of both. Students accepted by Vincennes University into the program will transfer with junior status.
