Designated as a national arboretum, SU is located in the natural learning lab of the Eastern Shore, halfway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Chesapeake Bay. The beauty and friendliness of campus contributed to SU’s designation on Rugg’s Recommendations list of “Magic Dream” schools – “campuses you visit and fall in love with” and inclusion among the “50 Most Amazing University Botanical Gardens and Arboretums in the U.S.”

https://www.salisbury.edu/afford-college/how-to-apply.aspx	p		a	The IRS Data Retrieval Tool allows applicants who have already filed their federal income tax returns to prefill the answers to some questions on the 
https://www.salisbury.edu/afford-college/how-to-apply.aspx	a			Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
https://www.salisbury.edu/afford-college/how-to-apply.aspx	p			 by transferring data from their federal income tax returns. This can save the family some time in completing the FAFSA. It may also reduce the likelihood that your FAFSA will be selected for verification.
https://www.salisbury.edu/afford-college/how-to-apply.aspx	p			In order to utilize the IRS Data Retrieval Tool applicants must have a valid Social Security Number and FSA ID to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. The applicant will need to authenticate himself or herself to the IRS in order to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. Students and parents must use the tool separately for their respective income tax returns.
https://www.salisbury.edu/afford-college/how-to-apply.aspx	p			You will not be able to utilize the IRS Data Retrieval Tool if you are an independent applicant is married and files separate federal income tax returns or a dependent applicant's parents are married and file separate federal income tax returns (e.g., married filing separately or head of household), the applicant will not be able to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. Also, if there has been a change in the marital status of the applicant or parent (if the applicant is a dependent student) after the end of the tax year, the applicant will not be able to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool.  It’s also important to note that the IRS Data Retrieval Tool will only transfer information from an original income tax return and not an amended income tax return.  Finally, Applicants who have filed a foreign income tax return instead of or in addition to a US income tax return will be unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. For example, taxpayers who file both a US income tax return and a Puerto Rican tax return will be unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. Also, the IRS Data Retrieval Tool is available only to taxpayers who have a valid Social Security number. Taxpayers who file income tax returns using a Tax ID Number (TIN) will not be able to use the tool.
