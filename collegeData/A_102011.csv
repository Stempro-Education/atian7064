http://www.vcu.edu/admissions	h2			There is no typical here â and definitely no cookie-cutter formula for being a good fit.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions	p			What helps? A love for city living. A desire to meet people different from yourself. And a hunger to chase every opportunity.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions	p			At VCU students are encouraged to conduct research, start businesses and serve the community â all before they graduate.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions	p			We provide top-ranked academic programs, research opportunities and an urban setting so you can live and learn in the real world.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions	h3			 Tuition & Aid
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions	p		a	We know money matters. For many, itâs a big factor in the school you choose. Thatâs why we work with students to find scholarships, grants and loans that ease the burden of 
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions	a			paying for college

http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	a			Graduate Bulletin
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	li			. If the program requires supplemental application materials such as reference letters or resumes, send them directly to the program unless it asks you to send all documents to the Office of Admissions.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	li			If your name has changed since you last attended, applied to, worked for or filed for financial aid at VCU, you must note your previous and current name on all submitted documents.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	li			Submit a separate application, application fee and complete set of official documentation for each graduate program you apply for.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	p			Late applications may be accepted under some circumstances, but students who do not apply at least one month before the semester begins risk losing eligibility for financial aid.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	h2			Application fee
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	p			A nonrefundable $70 application fee is required with each graduate program application. You will be asked to submit your payment at the end of your online application.

http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	p			For questions about transferring graduate credits, contact the director of the program to which youâre applying.

http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	p			For in-state tuition rates, you must be a Virginia resident or provide clear documentation that you are living in Virginia for a primary purpose other than attending school. Your graduate school letter of acceptance will state your residency status.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	h2			Required materials

http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	p			If offered admission, you will be directed and required to submit to the VCU admissions office an official transcript from any institution from which a degree has been awarded to finalize your admission. Transcripts are considered official if they are sent to VCU directly from the issuing institution.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	p			Official transcripts that are not in English must be accompanied by an official English translation. The Office of Admissions reserves the right to request English translations of diplomas prior to granting admission.
http://www.vcu.edu/admissions/apply/graduate	p			Prospective students who have studied outside of the U.S. must provide an official course-by-course external credential evaluation as a required part of the admission process. This report should be sealed and unopened, and sent directly to the Office of Admissions. All official transcripts and relevant credentials (e.g., diplomas and marksheets) will be required if admitted. All external credential evaluations should be no older than two years as of the official date received by the Office of Admissions. Once credentials and/or credential evaluations are sent to VCU, they will not be returned to the prospective student or sent to a third party.
