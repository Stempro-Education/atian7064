http://www.paulsmiths.edu/admissions/freshman	p		sup	 Paul Smith’s College operates on what is called a “rolling admissions” process, meaning we accept applications on a continuous basis throughout the year. There is no May 1

http://www.paulsmiths.edu/admissions/freshman	a			here

http://www.paulsmiths.edu/admissions/freshman	p		a	Once you complete your application, please visit your high school guidance office and request that they send us your high school transcript. For your convenience, feel free to use 
http://www.paulsmiths.edu/admissions/freshman	a			this form
http://www.paulsmiths.edu/admissions/freshman	p		strong	. Letters of Recommendation and a personal statement are encouraged for all applications, but not required.
