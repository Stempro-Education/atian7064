http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p			Financial Assistance Checklist
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	h2			STEP 1: Apply to Olivet Nazarene University.
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p		a	Scholarship funding is available through Olivet, for those who have 
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	a			applied for admission
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p			. Once you are admitted, you will receive notice of the awards for which you qualify. ONU offers merit scholarships for academics, music, art and athletics.
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	h2			STEP 2: Apply for federal and state grants.
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p		a	To begin the process of obtaining financial aid, fill out the 
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	a			Free Application for Federal Student Aid
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p		a	 (FAFSA). This form can be filled out 
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	a			online
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p		a	. Online application requires a 
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	a			FSA
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p			 for both you and a parent (if you are a dependent student).
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p		strong	FAFSA forms should be submitted after October 1 for the fall semester of the next calendar year. Some funding is limited, so for priority processing, submit the FAFSA as soon as possible. 
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	strong			Make sure to include Olivet’s school code: 001741
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p		a	You must submit a new 
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	a			FAFSA
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p			 each school year to be eligible for state and federal financial aid. The FAFSA is not required for admission to Olivet.
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	h2			STEP 3: Seek out additional scholarships made available through private funding.
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p		a	Talk to your high school guidance counselor and explore credible websites like 
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	a			www.fastweb.com
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	a			www.scholarships.com
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	a			www.discovernursing.com
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	p			, etc., to learn more about the available awards. Your local library, newspaper and community organizations are also good sources for scholarship information.
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	em			Beware of scholarship search services that may be scams or frauds. Do not pay for information or services that are provided free elsewhere!
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	h3			Financial Aid Guidelines
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	li			Most types of financial aid require the student to be enrolled full-time (at least 12 hours per semester).
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	li			Institutional funds are not awarded to students with less than a 2.0 high school or transfer GPA.
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	li			One-half of the total financial aid amount is awarded each semester.
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	li			To continue to receive aid, the student must make satisfactory progress toward a degree.
http://www.olivet.edu/applying-aid	div			When filling out your FAFSA, use Olivet's FAFSA Code: 001741
