https://www.beaconcollege.edu/admissions/parents	p			It probably won’t surprise you to learn that Beacon College was founded by a group of parents over 25 years ago. These College Founders were searching for the right college for their students. They quickly became discouraged when they discovered the inadequate services offered at traditional colleges and universities. While certainly today more robust services are available at colleges nationwide, these services do not compare to those offered at Beacon College. Why is Beacon’s educational environment so unique? Because the entire College–every aspect of the College–is focused on your student’s individual learning needs and your student’s success beyond Beacon College.
https://www.beaconcollege.edu/admissions/parents	p			At a more traditional college or university the conversation does not revolve around how to make the curriculum and learning more available to students who learn differently. Faculty typically use teaching techniques geared to the average learner. They do not tackle the tougher issues of teaching to a variety of different learning styles. This is why the Beacon College faculty is different and why your student becomes so empowered and confident in their ability to learn. The faculty possess the passion and commitment to reach every student-learner, regardless of the challenge. It is assumed that every student admitted to Beacon College has the intellectual capacity to achieve both in their studies at Beacon, and also be successful in the workplace.
https://www.beaconcollege.edu/admissions/parents	p		b	You know your student better than anyone. You know how important it is to select the right college; for this is a unique chapter in your student’s life. The college journey represents the transition to independence and responsible adulthood that can be daunting for many students with learning differences. At Beacon College our job is devoted to your student’s ability to lead a full and rewarding life. Poised for the future and prepared to accomplish. Based on Beacon’s remarkable student outcomes 
https://www.beaconcollege.edu/admissions/parents	b			“we are the best at what we do.”
https://www.beaconcollege.edu/admissions/parents	p			As you learn more about Beacon College, it may be helpful to know that our location in central Florida, a short distance from Orlando, is of great benefit to our students seeking internships and work experience with major corporations and employers nearby. Already Disney, Jet Blue, Southwest, Sea World, JP Morgan, etc. are working with Beacon to create unique student/employer work opportunities. We know the transition to work for students with learning differences can be difficult. We want to assure that Beacon College students enter the marketplace confident and with the necessary work-related skills. Our corporate partners share our vision of a promising and satisfying future for Beacon College graduates.
https://www.beaconcollege.edu/admissions/parents	p			Beacon College is still accepting applications for the upcoming semester, and scholarships are still available for qualifying students. As the admissions process is competitive, it is recommended that students apply early. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis until the fall class of 100 students is full.

http://www.beaconcollege.edu	h2			Beacon College–where life’s adventure truly begins.
http://www.beaconcollege.edu	p			Beacon is the first accredited college offering four year degrees designed around the needs of students with diagnosed learning disabilities. We offer both bachelor and associate degrees in an environment specifically created to help our students thrive and engineer amazing, abundant lives for themselves.
http://www.beaconcollege.edu	p			For students who learn differently – those with diagnosed learning disabilities, dyslexia, ADHD and related conditions — that adventure can be tough. Frequently, they are asked to make do with a scattershot set of “accommodations” that are intended to level the playing field — but often leave gaps.
http://www.beaconcollege.edu	p			Our students’ success can be measured — see Beacon By The Numbers below.

http://www.beaconcollege.edu	time			January 13, 2020
http://www.beaconcollege.edu	div			As an attorney, Carolyn Jeppsen is used to fighting for justice. Outside the courtroom, she has used her skills as both a litigator and Mama Bear of a child with disabilities to bring the fight to society. Jeppsen for more than 15 years has served on boards of organizations that champion clients with disabilities. Now as CEO and president of BroadFutures, an organization she, Diana Eisenstat, and Brad Holmes co-founded to champion a more inclusive workforce, Jeppsen is making the case for neurodiversity in the workplace, while empowering young people to succeed.

http://www.beaconcollege.edu	time			December 20, 2019
http://www.beaconcollege.edu	div			For collegians who struggle with Dick and Jane readers, bolstering their reading skills echoes another famous literary couple, Jack and Jill — as in uphill battle. That struggle led a group of students enrolled in reading strategies classes at Beacon College in December to raise cups of chilly lemonade during the Reading/Writing celebration and offer a “toast for change” to mark their strides up that tortuous hill.
