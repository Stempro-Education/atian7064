http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	strong			Transfer Nursing Applicants:
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			 PLNU is NOT accepting applications into our 3 year BSN or LVN to BSN Programs for the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years, and PLNU does not admit Pre-Nursing transfer students. For more information, scroll down to Nursing FAQ.
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			To be considered for admission into PLNU, you must have a complete application, including all college/university transcripts, high school transcripts and SAT or ACT scores (if you’ve completed 35 units or fewer), and two letters of recommendation.
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p		a	PLNU does not have specific courses that must be completed prior to transferring, except for nursing (see requirements below). You can apply to PLNU with any number of units or credits, but if you have completed fewer than 36 transferable units at the time you apply, we require you to submit your final high school transcripts and SAT or ACT scores in addition to your college transcripts to complete your file.

http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	h3			What if I'm a veteran or active duty military applicant?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			If you’re a veteran or still serving in the military, our admissions counselors will help you with everything from submitting transcripts and academic planning to VA benefits and other financial aid. We’ll even have your transcripts evaluated before you apply for admission to see which of your military credits can be transferred.
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p		br	All undergraduate programs can be completed in 36 months or less to accommodate terms of eligibility for your military benefits. Because our undergraduate degrees will not require you to use your maximum benefits, you can use any remaining eligibility toward one of our graduate degree programs.

http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	h3			What if I'm interested in the Nursing program?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	strong			What are the prerequisite courses needed to apply as a transfer to PLNU’s School of Nursing?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	li			Inorganic and organic biological chemistry -or- organic chemistry (4 or 5 semester units – with labs)
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	li			Human anatomy and physiology (8 semester units – with labs)
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	li			General psychology or personal identity (3 or 4 semester units)
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	li			College-level algebra (determined by PLNU math placement test)
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	li			Microbiology (4 semester units with lab)
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	strong			I don’t see Nursing as a major option on the application...what does that mean?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			From time to time, PLNU’s Nursing program completely fills up with continuing PLNU students. Rather than collect application fees from hopeful transfers who have no shot at getting into the program, we remove “Nursing” as an option on our application entirely, to prevent any students from wasting their time and money.
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	strong			I’d like to apply to PLNU as a non-Nursing major and then change into Nursing once admitted. Is that ok?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			Unfortunately no. In order to be in the Nursing program at PLNU, transfer students have to apply as Nursing majors, and be admitted as Nursing majors. There is no option for a student to apply to PLNU as any non–Nursing major and ever join the Nursing program. 
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	strong			I’d like to enroll at PLNU as a non-Nursing major and then change into Nursing once I’m there. Is that ok?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			No PLNU student in any non-Nursing major is ever able to change into the Nursing program, no matter the circumstance. Nursing is a locked major–students must be admitted as a Nursing major to ever be a part of the program.
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	strong			I’ve taken some of the Nursing prerequisite courses, but want to finish the rest at PLNU – can I do that?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			No. To be considered a viable PLNU transfer Nursing candidate, you must have completed all prerequisites before applying to the School of Nursing. This also means you can’t be in the semester-of-completion of any prerequisite course when applying to PLNU. Each course has to be completed.  
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	strong			I have taken college classes after graduating high school, but I haven’t taken any Nursing prerequisites. Can I apply as a transfer into the Pre-Nursing program to complete prerequisites at PLNU?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			Unfortunately no. If you’ve taken ANY college units after graduating from high school, you’re considered a transfer applicant to PLNU. All transfer applicants must have completed all Nursing prerequisite courses before applying to PLNU.
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	strong			I applied to PLNU as a transfer Nursing major – now what?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p		a	If PLNU is accepting Nursing transfers, once you’ve completed your PLNU Admissions application, you also need to apply to the School of Nursing. The School of Nursing application process is different than the admissions process, and has different deadlines. 
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	a			Please visit their site for additional information
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	h3			Does PLNU accept the ADT?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			Many California community colleges participate in the ADT program (Associates Degree for Transfer) that guarantees students who graduate with their ADT a space at some four year institutions. PLNU participates in the ADT program in these specific majors: Art History, Child and Adolescent Development, Literature, Criminal Justice, History, Journalism, Mathematics, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Social Work, Sociology. If you're applying as a transfer to PLNU in one of these majors, you'll be asked to submit a copy of your completed ADT at the time of application.

http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	a			Request More Info
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			To be considered for admission into PLNU, you must have a complete application, including high school and/or college transcripts, English proficiency scores (see below for accepted exams), two essays, and two letters of recommendation. You also have the option of conducting an interview with the international admissions counselor, which is highly recommended.
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	h3			 How can I have my coursework evaluated and approved to receive credit at PLNU?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p		a	For transcript evaluation, PLNU strongly suggests using 
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	a			Academic Credentials Evaluation Institute (ACEI)
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p		a	, but we will accept accredited transcripts from members of 
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	a			National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES)
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	a			Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE)
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p			". For first-time freshmen applicants, you need to request a course-by-course evaluation with a GPA. Transfer applicants looking to receive credit from a foreign college need to request a course-by-course evaluation with the course description and GPA. At ACEI, this is called the ""Course Match Evaluation"". If you have any questions regarding what evaluation type you should choose, please contact the international admissions counselor. PLNU is not responsible for evaluating foreign transcripts or coursework."
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	h3			Am I eligible for scholarships as an international student?
http://www.pointloma.edu/undergraduate/admissions/how-apply	p		a	Yes! International students are eligible for an International Merit Scholarship based on their GPA and TOEFL/IELTS scores. Students should contact their
