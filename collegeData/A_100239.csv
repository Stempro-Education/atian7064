http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	h3	div		The Online Application Fee Waiver
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p			In case of financial hardship, the CSU allows for a limited number of undergraduate application fee waivers for residents of California. If you file the admission application via Cal State Apply, the fee waiver request is included in the online system as part of the application process. You will be notified at the time you apply online if you qualify for the fee waiver. If granted a fee waiver, it may be used for up to 4 campuses for each application term.
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p			To be considered for the application fee waiver, you must be:
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			An undergraduate student (you cannot be in an extension program)
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			A California resident for more than one year
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			A U.S. citizen, or someone without lawful immigration status who qualifies for an AB540 non-resident tuition exception
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	em			Application fee waivers are not available for residents of other U.S. states, international students, and Graduate/post-bac program applicants. The CSU does not accept College Board fee waivers, nor any other external waiver form.
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	strong			Mistakes to Avoid
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p			The following common information reporting errors may cause an eligible applicant not to receive an application fee waiver:
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			If you report yourself as a dependent applicant with a family size of one
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			If you report the same dollar amount in the Adjusted Gross Income field as well as in the Untaxed Income field

http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p	ul		Applicants who incorrectly report any of the items above will not be granted an application fee waiver.

http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	a			Application Fee Waiver Checklist
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	h3	div		Residency
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p			Select the US state which you regard as your permanent home, regardless of your legal capacity to establish residency. If you select California, indicate whether you claim California residency and, if so, whether you have lived in California continuously since birth.
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	strong			DACA, undocumented, or AB540 students:
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			"In your Cal State Apply profile, select ""None"" for U.S. citizenship status."

http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	h3			How to Find Your High School
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p			Accurately finding your high school(s) from the list of available schools in the Cal State Apply application is very important. Doing so will ensure a smoother application process by making it easier for you to complete the High School Coursework section.
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p			Here are a few things to keep in mind when using the High School search:
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li		ul	When searching by the school's address, do not use the city or zip code where you live; always use the school's address.   
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			For example: Although many students from the city of Monterey Park, CA attend Mark Keppel High School, the school is located in Alhambra, CA. If these students search for a school in Monterey Park, they will not find their high school. They must search for the high school in Alhambra.
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			"If searching by a city, do not abbreviate. For example, ""Los Angeles"" should not be entered as ""LA""."
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li		a	If you can't find your school by location, you may also search by the 
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	a			College Board's CEEB code
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			. Consult your school's website, or ask your guidance counselor, for your high school's CEEB code.

http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p			Students who are transferring from institutions where formal articulation does not exist, or if a match is not available in ASSIST, must compare course descriptions to determine whether a course 'reasonably' matches the specified Cal State LA course.
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p		a	"Cal State LA ""Course Descriptions"" can be found in the "
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	strong			University Catalog
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	strong			When comparing course descriptions, it is important to pay attention to the following key information:
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			Does the course cover the key content areas of the Cal State LA course?
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			Does the course have the same or higher prerequisites to enroll in the course?
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			Does the course contain a lab or other required activity?
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			Are the unit values the same or greater at the student's current institution?
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	em			The courses have similar topics, both require labs, and same unit value – the two courses are reasonably similar; may be considered equivalent for Major-Specific Criteria prerequisite reporting.
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	strong			Additional Tips for Comparing Courses
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			The course should normally count for at least as many units as the course at Cal State LA. If the other institution is a quarter based school, multiply the quarter units by 0.66 to convert to Cal State LA semester units.
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			Many Cal State LA courses have stated prerequisites. Check the prerequisites for the course of the other institution to ensure that they are similar. A course that requires Calculus as a prerequisite is probably at a higher level than a course that only requires College Algebra as the prerequisite.
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li		ul	Look for similarities between the two course descriptions:     
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			Do they use some of the same vocabulary?
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	li			Do they cover the similar content areas?
http://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/application-tips	p	ul		 Although students may be admitted with coursework that reasonably meets the Cal State LA course objectives, additional coursework may be required for graduation should the course be deemed not fully equivalent upon formal review.
