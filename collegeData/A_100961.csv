https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	h2			Bio
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	p			I am originally from the Dallas Texas area. Before moving to California, I lived in Paris, France for a year doing mission work. Now I am in California working on my online MBA through The Master’s University and working as an admissions counselor. This is an amazing place to work and study!
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	p			In my free time I like to paint watercolors, be outside, and visit fun places around Los Angeles. There is so much to do here in Santa Clarita: great little cafes, coffee shops, museums and the beach! One of my favorite coffee shops is a local place just down the street from TMU.
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	p			Transitioning from high school to University life is such an important and fun season. There is a great amount to learn and the University you choose will help shape who you become in the future. That is why I love being an admissions counselor and I am here to help you in the process.
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	p			“A man’s heart plans his way, But the LORD directs his steps.” Proverbs 16:9
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	p		strong	My recommendation to prospective students is to start by reading the TMU 
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	a			mission and doctrinal statement
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	p		strong	, and then to explore the 
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	a			undergraduate degrees  and programs
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	p		strong	  -  or even better, to do that in person at our 
https://www.masters.edu/admissions/lydia	a			visit days
