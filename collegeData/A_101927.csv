http://www.uscb.edu/admissions	blockquote			âLiving at Palmetto Village at the Bluffton campus is like living in a separate community                            in and of itselfâit really is apartment-style living at its finest. Iâve had some                            of my most life-changing experiences in this community, and I wouldnât have moved                            off campus for the world. Iâve really enjoyed the convenience of on-campus living,                            as well as the connections Iâve made with other students. Iâve discovered important                            and lasting friendships with fellow classmatesâpeople who are now my best friends.
