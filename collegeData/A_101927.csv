http://www.uscb.edu/admissions	blockquote			Ã¢ÂÂLiving at Palmetto Village at the Bluffton campus is like living in a separate community                            in and of itselfÃ¢ÂÂit really is apartment-style living at its finest. IÃ¢ÂÂve had some                            of my most life-changing experiences in this community, and I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have moved                            off campus for the world. IÃ¢ÂÂve really enjoyed the convenience of on-campus living,                            as well as the connections IÃ¢ÂÂve made with other students. IÃ¢ÂÂve discovered important                            and lasting friendships with fellow classmatesÃ¢ÂÂpeople who are now my best friends.
