http://medicine.wright.edu/admissions	div	div		Peer Instruction at Wright State University
http://medicine.wright.edu/admissions	p			Medical schools in the United States all cover the same content. The differences lie in how the content is presented, sequenced and integrated. The WrightCurriculum starts with the Foundations of Clinical Practice, integrating biomedical, clinical and health care sciences step by step. This is followed by the Doctoring phase that provides a rich set of clinical experiences in hospitals, clinics and practices. Advanced Doctoring provides adequate elective time to help clarify your specialty choice and advanced clinical experiences prepare you for the rigors of residency.
http://medicine.wright.edu/admissions	p			Throughout all four years, you will have opportunities for community health advocacy, research and global health experiences. The WrightCurriculum will provide you ample opportunities to acquire and apply the fundamental knowledge and skills to be successful on the national licensing exams. Your time in class will be devoted to solving authentic problems with your peers. Through this interaction guided by faculty, you will master difficult concepts while improving self-awareness, critical thinking and communication skills.
http://medicine.wright.edu/admissions	p			All students complete a scholarly project before graduation, which teaches the process of hypothesis generation, data collection, literature review and publication. Many students also pursue an additional degree through a dual-degree program.
