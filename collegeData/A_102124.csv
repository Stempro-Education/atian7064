http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	td		br	                   These estimates do not represent a final determination, or actual award, of financial assistance or a final net                   price; they are only estimates based on cost of attendance and financial aid provided to students in 2016-17.                   Cost of attendance and financial aid availability change year to year. These estimates shall not be binding on                   the Secretary of Education, the institution of higher education, or the State.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	td		a	                    Not all students receive financial aid. In 2016-17, 98% of our full-time students enrolling                   for college for the first time received grant/scholarship aid. Students may also be eligible                   for student loans and work-study. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student                   Aid (FAFSA) in order to determine their eligibility for Federal financial aid that includes                   Federal grant, loan, or work-study assistance. For more information on applying for                   Federal student aid, go to

http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	h2			Financial Planning FAQs
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	h2			General
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	a			Do I need to complete the FAFSA?
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	a			When will I receive my financial aid information?
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	a			How do I apply for financial aid to attend Wingate University?
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	a			What information is included in my award package?
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	p			We recommend that you complete the application for your first year, even if you do not think you will qualify for financial aid. After you see how much federal, state and institutional financial aid you’re eligible to receive, you can decide if you want to complete it again in subsequent years.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	p			We’ll mail your financial aid award package approximately four weeks after you submit the FAFSA and have completed the enrollment process with the Office of Admissions.  Award packages are issued on a rolling basis beginning in February.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	p		br	Complete the FAFSA annually and be sure to include the Wingate University school code, 002985. The FAFSA is available beginning October 1.  We encourage you to complete the application before our priority deadline of March 1.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	p			Your award package will outline the various types of aid for which you qualify. This may include a combination of academic scholarships, need-based grants, federal loans and/or work-study eligibility.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	h2			Verification 
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	a			What is verification?
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	a			How do I get a copy of my IRS tax return transcript?  
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	a			I didn’t file a tax return for the year in question. What do I do now? 
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	a			How do I submit my forms once they’re completed? 
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	p			Please don’t be concerned if the Department of Education or Wingate University selects your FAFSA for verification. You haven’t done anything wrong. This is a standard procedure that many students are asked to complete to confirm the accuracy of the data you submitted on your FAFSA. Verification requires you to submit additional information, such as tax return transcripts or other information, before a final decision is made on your financial aid eligibility. We will notify you of any additional information you need to provide.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	p			There are three ways to get your tax return transcripts:
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	li			By phone: Call the IRS Tax Transcript Center at 800–908–9946. Your paper transcript should be mailed in 5–10 business days.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	li		a	Online: 
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	a			Go to the IRS website
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	li			. Select “Get Transcript Online.” Request your tax return transcript for the year in question. You should be able to immediately view and print your transcript.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	li		br	Via Short Form Request for Individual Tax Return Transcript (Form 4506T-EZ): Download the form. Don’t complete Section 5 (Release to Third Party); you want the transcript mailed directly to you. Mail or fax your request to the office specified on the second page of the form. Your paper transcript should be mailed in 5–10 business days.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	p			You are still required to complete the verification worksheet. You’ll need to attest to the fact that you didn’t file and/or won’t be filing a Federal Tax Return for the year in question and that it wasn’t necessary for you to do so. You’ll also need to submit any additional documents that have been requested, such as copies of all of your W-2 forms from employers.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	p			You have three options for submitting your forms:
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/financial-aid	li			By mail: Office of Student Financial Planning PO Box 159 Wingate, NC 28174-0159

http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/visit/visit-us	p			Early fall is a great time for high school seniors to visit campus. Bulldog Scholars Day, which includes a briefing from President Brown, panel discussions and more, is held in late September. (Be on the lookout for an email invitation). If you miss it, no worries, you can still sign up for a personalized campus visit during which you'll be able to check out the dining hall, library, academic buildings, the fitness center and a residence hall. Our student-led campus tours are a great chance to ask questions and get a first-hand feel for Bulldog life. 
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/visit/visit-us	p		a	Future Scholars Day is designed just for motivated high school juniors and sophomores who've previously expressed interest in Wingate and want to learn more. You'll hear President Brown's Briefing on  Financial Aid and Scholarships, attend panel discussions and tour campus with a student NaviGATEtour. This event is a great way to get a head start on exploring Bulldog life. The next Future Scholars Day will be held on March 14, 2020. Look for your invitation closer to the event date or contact 
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/visit/visit-us	a			visit@wingate.edu
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/visit/visit-us	p			 for more information.
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/visit/visit-us	p		a	Spring is a great time for admitted students to visit campus and get a better feel for Bulldog life. That's why we've designed Become a Bulldog Day just for admitted students who could benefit from more information before depositing. You'll get a closer look at academic programs, financing a college education and campus life. Panel discussions featuring students, alumni and faculty are a great way to learn what to expect as an enrolled student. You'll get a real feel for our nurturing Bulldog community when you tour campus and enjoy lunch with faculty. The next Become a Bulldog Day is scheduled for March 28, 2020. Check your inbox for an invitation in the spring or contact 
http://www.wingate.edu/admissions/visit/visit-us	p			Fall semester classes continue through Dec. 2, with the exception of Fall Break, which is Oct. 7-8. The spring session runs from Jan. 8 to April 27, with the exception of Spring Break, which is March 2-6. Visits are available on days when classes are not in session, but if you'd like to meet with faculty or attend a class, you'll want to keep these dates in mind.
