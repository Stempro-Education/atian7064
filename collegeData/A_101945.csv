http://www.uta.edu/admissions/apply/transfer	h2			Transferring Credit Qualifications 
http://www.uta.edu/admissions/apply/transfer	p		br	One of the cool things about being a transfer student is that you get to bring your credit with you! Shortly after you've been admitted to the University, your transfer credits will be evaluated and posted to your MyMav Student Center.
http://www.uta.edu/admissions/apply/transfer	p			 We've outlined these general transfer qualifications to help you anticipate transferring your courses.
http://www.uta.edu/admissions/apply/transfer	li			"UTA only accepts classes where you earned a ""C"" or better, so keep your grades up to receive as much credit as possible. Vocational coursework is not transferable."
http://www.uta.edu/admissions/apply/transfer	li			Developmental coursework is not transferable.
http://www.uta.edu/admissions/apply/transfer	li			"Transfer students have no option for erasing a low grade. UTA will not use ""grade replacement,"" ""grade forgiveness,"" ""grade exclusion,"" or any other type of amnesty from the grades you earned. "
http://www.uta.edu/admissions/apply/transfer	li			UTA does not recognize life and/or career credit.
http://www.uta.edu/admissions/apply/transfer	li			While you may be core complete, there may be a major course requirement or prerequisite that require you to take a course that looks like a core requirement, but doesn't act like one. You should talk with your academic advisor to discuss these requirements. 
http://www.uta.edu/admissions/apply/transfer	h2			Transfer Admissions Timeline
