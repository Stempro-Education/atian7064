http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	h3			Philosophy
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	p			An education here is like no other. Our undergraduate programs are both academically                      rigorous and personally transformative. Naropa University offers a whole-person education                      for students who desire to become the change they want to see in the world. We recognize                      the unhealthy tension that many exclusionary admission practices nationwide cause                      students and their families. Naropa is committed to an admissions policy that mitigates                      this tension while emphasizing diversity and inclusion, reflecting the true nature                      of contemplative education in the process.                   
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	p			The goal of the Office of Admissions is to find students who are prepared for the                      work ahead.                   
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	p			Students should not confuse our non-traditional admissions process with a lack of                      academic rigor. A Naropa education requires extensive reading, academic research,                      writing, and hands-on exploration associated with a curriculum that inspires deep                      introspection, self-growth, and an acute level of emotional intelligence. Naropa’s                      small class sizes and dedicated faculty demand thoughtful preparation and engagement                      from all students in an educational environment that emphasizes mindfulness and academic                      inquiry.                   
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	p			If you have a history of strong academic performance, we welcome you into our community                      with minimal admissions requirements so that we may begin the work of preparing you                      to succeed. We also recognize that prior academic performance may not accurately reflect                      your potential for success at Naropa. If your academic performance has not been strong                      in the past, but you believe that you could benefit from a Naropa education and effectively                      contribute to the Naropa community, we strongly encourage you to begin the application                      process now.                   
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	h3			Process
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	p			Fill out a short admissions application and submit your transcripts. An Admissions                      Counselor will make every attempt to review your application and issue a decision                      within a week of receiving all required documents. The documents you are required                      to submit depend on your prior academic performance. If you have any questions about                      which documents we require of you, you can simply begin by completing the admissions                      application.                   
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	p		a	We are here to support you through this process. Please do not hesitate to contact

http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	strong			Notice to all applicants to Naropa University: 
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/bachelors/how-to-apply.php	p			Numerous Naropa programs require students to complete a practicum, internship or student                      teaching experience in order to meet degree requirements. Please be aware that many                      of these sites require students to have up-to-date immunizations, complete and pass                      a background check and complete and pass a drug screen prior to student placement.                      Medical and recreational marijuana is not exempt from drug testing. It is the responsibility                      of all program students to secure placement at a site and meet site requirements for                      entry. Any student unable to meet site requirements and secure placement will not                      be able to complete degree requirements successfully. By applying for a Naropa program                      with such degree requirements, you are acknowledging that you must successfully complete                      and pass background checks and drug screens and have current immunization records.                      Any student who may not be able to meet these requirements are entering the program                      assuming the risk that they may not be able to successfully complete degree requirements.

http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/masters/how-to-apply.php	p			 Applicants may not apply to more than one graduate program at a time. Programs cannot                      be combined into custom, interdisciplinary programs.                   
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/masters/how-to-apply.php	strong			Notice to all applicants to Naropa University: 
http://www.naropa.edu/admissions/masters/how-to-apply.php	p			Numerous Naropa programs require students to complete a practicum, internship or student                      teaching experience in order to meet degree requirements. Please be aware that many                      of these sites require students to have up-to-date immunizations, complete and pass                      a background check and complete and pass a drug screen prior to student placement.                      Medical and recreational marijuana is not exempt from drug testing. It is the responsibility                      of all program students to secure placement at a site and meet site requirements for                      entry. Any student unable to meet site requirements and secure placement will not                      be able to complete degree requirements successfully. By applying for a Naropa program                      with such degree requirements, you are acknowledging that you must successfully complete                      and pass background checks and drug screens and have current immunization records.                      Any student who may not be able to meet these requirements are entering the program                      assuming the risk that they may not be able to successfully complete degree requirements.
