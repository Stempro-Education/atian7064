https://apply.cca.edu/events	h2			Welcome
https://apply.cca.edu/events	h2			A creative community unlike anywhere else
https://apply.cca.edu/events	h3			One college, two dynamic campuses
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	h3		There are two CCA campuses in the Bay Area, and as a student you’ll spend time at both. The First Year Program spans both campuses, and first-year students have the opportunity to live in residence halls at either location. Our undergraduate programs are spread throughout both campuses as well, while most of our graduate programs are based in San Francisco.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	b			San Francisco campus
https://apply.cca.edu/events	a			1111 Eighth Street
https://apply.cca.edu/events	li			) is located in the urban Potrero Hill neighborhood. Here, you’ll find the Nave, a sunlit corridor surrounded by student studios in our main building that’s the hub of CCA’s critique culture. Nearby is the Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts and Hubbell Street Galleries. New student housing in Blattner Hall is just two blocks away.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	b			Oakland campus
https://apply.cca.edu/events	a			5212 Broadway
https://apply.cca.edu/events	li	li		) is located on four beautifully landscaped acres in the Rockridge district at Broadway and College Avenue. It’s home to student galleries, classrooms, work spaces, and residence halls. CCA’s founder Frederick Meyer, a skilled horticulturist, purchased this site in 1922, and much of his landscaping work is still evident today.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p			View inside our studios, student center, makerspaces, and more.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	h3			Find the freedom to explore
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	h3		The confluence of our prime location, our diverse creative community, and our interdisciplinary curriculum focused on socially engaged projects is what makes life at CCA so unique.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	p		In San Francisco, we’re connected to the contemporary art scene, as well as industry partners who we work with to build design-led technological solutions. In Oakland, we have spaces dedicated to using art and design to support social activism and rethink ecological resilience.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p		a	Each campus offers state-of-the art facilities and a stimulating environment to inspire students’ creativity. Come see for yourself. Experiencing CCA first-hand is the best way to determine why you belong at the 
https://apply.cca.edu/events	a			top art and design school
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p			 in the country.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	p	a	You can

https://apply.cca.edu/events	h3			How to take an in-person tour of CCA
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	h3		We offer separate campus tours at San Francisco and Oakland, Mondays through Fridays (unless we’re on a holiday or academic break), at the following times. We also offer campus tours on select Saturdays and Sundays.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	b			Oakland campus undergraduate tours

https://apply.cca.edu/events	h4	h3		Make the most of your visit
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	h4		Even though one campus might end up being your “home campus” as a student, we strongly recommend you plan to tour both. This will give you a deeper understanding of the range of artmaking made possible by CCA’s uniquely interdisciplinary ethos.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	p		All tours—undergraduate and graduate, San Francisco and Oakland—include a session with an admissions counselor that covers additional information about our programs, financial aid opportunities, portfolio requirements, and application process.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	h4			Undergraduate tours
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	h4		If it’s not possible to attend both campus tours, we recommend prospective undergraduate students visit whichever location is home to their program of interest.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	p	a	On an undergraduate Oakland campus tour, you’ll explore First Year Program classrooms, current students’ favorite hangout spots, our edible and dye garden, and 
https://apply.cca.edu/events	a			residence halls
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	p		 exclusively for first-year students, as well as studios, labs, and workshops for all Oakland-based undergraduate academic programs (view below).
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p		a	On an undergraduate San Francisco campus tour, you’ll walk the Nave and tour classrooms, programmatic studios, our sound stage, production spaces, labs, and more places where our students’ hybrid, experimental practices take shape. You’ll also check out our new student residence, 
https://apply.cca.edu/events	a			Blattner Hall
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p			, designed for continuing and graduate students, which is only two blocks from the workspaces of undergraduate academic programs that call San Francisco campus home (view below).
https://apply.cca.edu/events	b			Note:
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	p		 Sophomore- and junior-level Painting and Drawing courses are offered on both campuses, while senior-level courses and students’ individual senior studios are offered at the San Francisco campus. Students interested in this program would benefit from touring both campuses.

https://apply.cca.edu/events	h4			Graduate tours
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	h4		Rather than stick to one siloed path of study, we tend to work across multiple disciplines, pulling inspiration from the Bay Area. You’ll see these hybridity principles and creative adjacencies on full display during your tour of the San Francisco campus.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	p	a	You’ll explore the main building, where graduate students often work as teaching assistants; graduate student housing in the new, nearby 
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	p		; individual graduate program studios, including the graduate design studio and the graduate architecture studio; the writers’ studio and its Japanese-inspired garden, idyllic for writing; and the Graduate Center, home to the graduate computer lab, VCS program spaces, exhibitions catalogs, library, and more. At the end of your tour, we recommend you visit the prestigious CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, where graduate students go for visiting artist exhibitions and participate in gallery events.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p	p		We strongly recommend that prospective MFA in Fine Arts students interested in the disciplines of glass, ceramics, jewelry and metal arts, photography, printmedia, or textiles also attend an undergraduate tour of the Oakland campus, where many of these programs’ studios are located.

https://apply.cca.edu/events	h2			How to get around both campuses
https://apply.cca.edu/events	h3			Common two-campus questions
https://apply.cca.edu/events	h4			                             Do I have to commute back and forth on a daily basis?                         
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p			Most students plan their schedule to minimize the commute between campuses.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	h4			                             How long is the commute between campuses?                         
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p		a	It can take as short as half an hour or as long as an hour or more, depending on traffic. Taking the 
https://apply.cca.edu/events	a			free intercampus shuttle
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p			 reduces the commute time.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	h4			                             Do I have enough time to commute between campuses?                         
https://apply.cca.edu/events	p			Yes, CCA gives students an hour between most classes.
https://apply.cca.edu/events	h4			                             How do I transport my projects between campuses?
