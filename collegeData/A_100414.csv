https://www.concordia-ny.edu/admission/impactu	h2			 for a life of purpose and impact
https://www.concordia-ny.edu/admission/impactu	p			Impact U is an immersive, 2-year, post-secondary program of Concordia College where adults aged 18-26 with  intellectual and developmental disabilities can find the supports and safeguards necessary to participate fully in an inclusive college-living experience on campus with traditional college students. Students audit college level classes open to all students, share access to all campus facilities, activites and events, and live in an integrated residence hall among traditional Concordia College students. Impact U offers access to college life among same age typical peers as a means to safely and successfully increase autonomy and independent living skills. Impact U prepares students for employability in competitive, integrated job settings. Students engage in job readiness skills through prevocational training and supported employment in on-campus internships the first year, and possible off-campus internships the second year. Students graduate with a Certificate of Applied Learning and a resume of work experiences.

The program encourages social and emotional growth while building skills in problem-solving, decision-making and self-advocacy.
