Whether you wish to earn a high school diploma, improve literacy skills, or learn English, IRSC offers many unique opportunities that lead you to college level classes, associate and bachelor degrees, technical certificates, quick job training, or apprenticeship programs that fit right into your future.
http://aecp.irsc.edu	strong			How To Get Started
http://aecp.irsc.edu	strong			Step 1
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font		a	 -  The first step to enrollment in the GED prep program is to complete the online 
http://aecp.irsc.edu	a			IRSC student application
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font			. Please select option #10.  When you complete the online application, you'll receive your student ID number and your RiverMail account information. Save your student ID number as it will never change. Be sure to always have this number handy whenever you're on campus. 
http://aecp.irsc.edu	span			Apply Here
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font			Step 2
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font			- Now that you've created your student ID number, call your nearest IRSC location to schedule  the TABE. The TABE is an assessment to identify the areas where you need help in reading, math, and language. Students under 18 must have school withdrawal documents to take the TABE.
http://aecp.irsc.edu	span			Find a location near you
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font			Step 3 
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font	strong		 After you take the TABE, you'll need to schedule a facilitation appointment to go over your scores, to sign the student agreement documents, to pick your schedule, and to go over any questions or concerns you may have. Students under 18 must have school withdrawal documents and be accompanied by a legal parent or guardian to this appointment.
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font			Step 4
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font	strong		 The intake facilitator will let you know when to pay the semester fee of $30 so you can be registered into your classes. This non-refundable fee covers all of your adult education classes for one semester.
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font			Step 5
http://aecp.irsc.edu	font	strong		Once you are registered, you can start your classes. We offer morning, afternoon, evening, and blended class sessions to fit your schedule. Students who wish to study online must complete additional requirements.
