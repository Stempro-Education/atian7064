http://www.rio.edu	a			Ken French
http://www.rio.edu	p		br	 watched his short-handed RedStorm give maximum effort in a win at Brescia University on Thursday night.
http://www.rio.edu	p		br	    French's squad came up with the same kind of showing against a much better foe on Saturday afternoon, but the inability to hang on to the basketball prevented his club from recording a monumental upset.
http://www.rio.edu	p		br	    Indiana University Southeast overcame a seven-point halftime deficit and survived would-be game-winning shots at the end of both regulation and the first overtime session before pulling away in the second extra period for an 88-78 win in River States Conference action at the IUS Activities Building.
http://www.rio.edu	p		br	    The Grenadiers, who received votes in the most recent NAIA Division II coaches' poll, improved to 12-5 overall and 5-1 in league play with the victory.
http://www.rio.edu	p			    Rio Grande slipped to 9-11 overall and 2-4 in the RSC with the loss.
