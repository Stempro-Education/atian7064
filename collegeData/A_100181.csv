Direct admission to academic majors, programs with advanced standing, or placement by exam or audition will be determined by the individual department/program. Applicants are advised to contact the department/program prior to requesting a deferment.
https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	h3			Deadlines and Timeline:

https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	h3			Required Materials:
https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	p			Before a student’s admission can be moved to a new semester, the following items are required:
https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	li			Semester Switch request form.
https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	li			Final transcripts – if in-progress coursework was used for admission. A student’s semester of admission will only be moved if they continue to meet Boise State’s admission standards.
https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	strong			IMPORTANT: 
https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	p			If you are moving your semester of admission forward more than one semester (e.g. Fall 2018 to Fall 2019), your request will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The following may apply:
https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	li			This type of request may be granted for non-academic reasons including, but not limited to, pursuing a religious mission, military service, humanitarian activities or travel. Students may also request a deferral for medical or personal reasons.
https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	li			Any academic coursework attempted during the period of deferment will void your admission decision.
https://www.boisestate.edu/admissions/apply/switch	p			Failure to meet any of these terms may result in the revocation of admission. In such a case, an applicant will need to reapply for admission to Boise State University by the appropriate application deadline, and will need to pay the application fee.
