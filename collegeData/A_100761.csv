https://www.iw.edu	p			“The strengths of Iowa Wesleyan include the solid curriculum, amazing instructors and the humble culture and demeanor. They impacted my leadership opportunities by giving me confidence from all the respectful relationships I developed – with faculty, staff and other students. Iowa Wesleyan teaches to an individual’s strengths, and inspires for success. I graduated knowing I would be successful – they made me feel that way.”
https://www.iw.edu	span			Mitchell Schneider ’17
https://www.iw.edu	p			“I would recommend Iowa Wesleyan to students who want professors that care about them and want to see them succeed outside of the classroom. Iowa Wesleyan helped me by preparing me for what the real world is like. The professors at Iowa Wesleyan are willing to push people to get 100 percent from them and will go out of their way to help students who are struggling. “
https://www.iw.edu	span			Becca Kokjohn: Elementary Education Major
https://www.iw.edu	em			“I went to a very small high school, so I didn’t want a large university. I didn’t want to sit in a large classroom and just blend in. At Iowa Wesleyan, all my teachers know me, and they know my goals. They are always there for me with the help and encouragement I need.”
https://www.iw.edu	span			​Seth Pugh: Elementary Education Major
https://www.iw.edu	em			“My coursework at Iowa Wesleyan provided me with the instructional strategies and classroom management skills that I need to be an effective teacher. The professors at IW are very knowledgeable and genuinely care about their students.”
https://www.iw.edu	span			Kaitlyn Dirth ’16
https://www.iw.edu	p			“What set IW apart for me was the small class sizes and clinical hours. I felt like I was able to work closely with my professors and was well prepared through many hours of clinical. IW has impacted my career opportunities by making me well prepared for life after college.  I felt as though I was ready to start in the emergency department once I finished school. It has also helped prepare me for continued education. I attribute being accepted into my Doctor of Nursing Practice program at Clarke University to the preparation and encouragement I received from my mentors at IW.”

https://www.iw.edu	i			“The classes I’ve taken at Iowa Wesleyan have helped convince me that I am destined to be a Special Education teacher.

https://www.iw.edu/admissions-office	p			Iowa Wesleyan University recognizes the value of your military experience and training. Did you know you can get college credit for your military experience? The American Council on Education (ACE) collaborates with Department of Defense (DoD) to review military training and experience and recommend appropriate college credit for members of the Armed Forces.
https://www.iw.edu/admissions-office	p			Iowa Wesleyan must receive an official copy of your military transcript to award any applicable transfer credits. The information below includes links to help you with the process of requesting your official military transcript. Please note that requesting your military transcript is branch specific.
https://www.iw.edu/admissions-office	p			If you have not already applied to Iowa Wesleyan University, please contact your Admissions Counsoler to request more information or an unofficial review of your transcripts for possible transfer credit.

You must have received an honorable discharge to be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

http://www.iw.edu	p			“The strengths of Iowa Wesleyan include the solid curriculum, amazing instructors and the humble culture and demeanor. They impacted my leadership opportunities by giving me confidence from all the respectful relationships I developed – with faculty, staff and other students. Iowa Wesleyan teaches to an individual’s strengths, and inspires for success. I graduated knowing I would be successful – they made me feel that way.”
http://www.iw.edu	span			Mitchell Schneider ’17
http://www.iw.edu	p			“I would recommend Iowa Wesleyan to students who want professors that care about them and want to see them succeed outside of the classroom. Iowa Wesleyan helped me by preparing me for what the real world is like. The professors at Iowa Wesleyan are willing to push people to get 100 percent from them and will go out of their way to help students who are struggling. “

http://www.iw.edu	em			“I went to a very small high school, so I didn’t want a large university. I didn’t want to sit in a large classroom and just blend in. At Iowa Wesleyan, all my teachers know me, and they know my goals. They are always there for me with the help and encouragement I need.”

http://www.iw.edu	p			“What set IW apart for me was the small class sizes and clinical hours. I felt like I was able to work closely with my professors and was well prepared through many hours of clinical. IW has impacted my career opportunities by making me well prepared for life after college.  I felt as though I was ready to start in the emergency department once I finished school. It has also helped prepare me for continued education. I attribute being accepted into my Doctor of Nursing Practice program at Clarke University to the preparation and encouragement I received from my mentors at IW.”
