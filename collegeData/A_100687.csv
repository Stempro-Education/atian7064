https://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	h3			Non-Discrimination Policy
https://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	p			Harvard University's policy is to make decisions concerning applicants, students, faculty, and staff on the basis of the individual's qualifications to contribute to Harvard's educational objectives and institutional needs. The principle of not discriminating against individuals based on characteristics such as race, color, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, political beliefs, veteran status, or disability unrelated to job or course of study requirements is consistent with the purposes of a university and with the law.
https://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	h3			Civic Engagement Statement
https://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	p			The mission of the Harvard Graduate School of Education is to prepare leaders in education and to generate knowledge to improve student opportunity, achievement, and success. Civic leadership and learning are important components of this mission. Those who engage responsibly in exercising their rights and freedoms will not have their chances of admission compromised, nor will admissions offers be revoked, regardless of whether they face disciplinary action by their schools or districts as a result of peaceful protest.
https://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	h3			Application Review Process
https://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	p			While our admissions process is highly selective, it is also personalized, comprehensive, and fair. There is no single formula or criterion for admission. HGSE looks for students with a passion for education, diverse life and work experiences, and a deep commitment to making an impact in the world — as educators, researchers, policymakers, and service-minded leaders of character and integrity.

http://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	h3			Non-Discrimination Policy
http://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	p			Harvard University's policy is to make decisions concerning applicants, students, faculty, and staff on the basis of the individual's qualifications to contribute to Harvard's educational objectives and institutional needs. The principle of not discriminating against individuals based on characteristics such as race, color, national or ethnic origin, age, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, political beliefs, veteran status, or disability unrelated to job or course of study requirements is consistent with the purposes of a university and with the law.
http://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	h3			Civic Engagement Statement
http://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	p			The mission of the Harvard Graduate School of Education is to prepare leaders in education and to generate knowledge to improve student opportunity, achievement, and success. Civic leadership and learning are important components of this mission. Those who engage responsibly in exercising their rights and freedoms will not have their chances of admission compromised, nor will admissions offers be revoked, regardless of whether they face disciplinary action by their schools or districts as a result of peaceful protest.
http://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	h3			Application Review Process
http://www.gse.harvard.edu/admissions/apply	p			While our admissions process is highly selective, it is also personalized, comprehensive, and fair. There is no single formula or criterion for admission. HGSE looks for students with a passion for education, diverse life and work experiences, and a deep commitment to making an impact in the world — as educators, researchers, policymakers, and service-minded leaders of character and integrity.
