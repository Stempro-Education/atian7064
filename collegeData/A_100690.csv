https://www.haverford.edu	p			Ten years ago, Katherine Gerbner was fortunate enough to hold the Gest Fellowship, which provided funding for a month of research at Haverford Quaker & Special Collections. She spent the month scouring 17th century Meeting records to try to understand better how Friends integrated slave-holding into their religious practice. She'll talk about what she found—and what she didn't find—during this informal discussion.

https://www.haverford.edu	p			Chase Auditorium
https://www.haverford.edu	p			Eighteenth-century Quakers were leaders of the abolitionist movement, but many seventeenth-century Quakers were slave owners. In Pennsylvania, William Penn was a slave-holder and leading English Quakers used their connections to Friends in Barbados to import enslaved men and women. Distinguished Visitor Katharine Gerbner will examine how these seventeenth-century Quakers reconciled slavery with their peace testimony and ask what it means to truly reckon with the history of Quaker slave-holding today.

https://www.haverford.edu	span	i		Monday, February 10, 2020
https://www.haverford.edu	p			In this Faculty Scholarship Talk, Assistant Professor of Religion Molly Farneth argues that people create, maintain, and transform boundaries around and within their communities through rituals. In doing so, people both recognize the salience of certain social roles and identities within their communities and distribute social goods and normative statuses in accordance with those roles and identities. This means that the presence or absence of rituals can be a matter of recognitive and distributive justice, whether a person or a group of people are recognized and given the goods and statuses that are their due. Through examples and theoretical analysis, Farneth suggests that the lack of ritual can be a form of injustice.
