http://www.bridgeport.edu	p		br	New Year's Day — Now is the accepted time to make your regular annual good resolutions. Next week you can begin paving hell with them as usual. — Mark Twain
http://www.bridgeport.edu	p			  I am a sentimentalist when it comes to New Year’s. Every year I make the same list: more reading, more exercise, more time for friends, more adult eating i.e. no fudge, no bacon, no beer. And every year, I tend to stray from the path of goodness and light fairly soon out of the gate. But this year will be different; I can just feel it.
