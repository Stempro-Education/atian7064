https://svu.edu/admissions	p			I used to tell people my claims to fame were playing on two National Championship football teams at the University of Oklahoma and serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South America. But now my claim to fame, together with my wife, is having raised five good children; four of whom have graduated from Southern Virginia. I grew up playing in rock bands, playing sports, and spending time with my family. My favorite band right now is Imagine Dragons.

My husband and I love to travel, experience new cultures, and explore—especially when we can bring along our golden doodle! Educationally, I earned a bachelor’s in history and anthropology and master’s in public administration from Southern Utah University.

Born and raised in Southern California, I served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Kyiv, Ukraine. My wife and I love living in Virginia and enjoy taking our two boys on hikes through the Blue Ridge. We really appreciate the history and beauty of the East Coast. I played volleyball and football in high school and I’m passionate about athletics—especially when supporting the Knights! This University has a special place in my heart and I feel blessed to be a part of it.

I love sitting outside with a good book, running trails in the Blue Ridge and Appalachian Mountains, and exploring Virginia’s rich history with my husband. I earned a bachelor’s degree in humanities and philosophy and am now working on my master’s in liberal studies with a concentration in English. I have a deeply-rooted passion for education and am amazed by how transformative my experience at Southern Virginia University has been. I am so excited to work with you and help you unlock those same opportunities!

https://svu.edu/admissions	p			I am a native Virginian who loves living in the Shenandoah Valley and working at Southern Virginia University. I joined the University to help coach men’s lacrosse and fell in love with sharing the message of this amazing school with prospective students. Now in admissions, I have the opportunity to share the benefits of this University on a much larger scale. I’m also a proud parent of Knights—my three oldest children attend Southern Virginia and are having fantastic experiences studying in the classroom and competing in NCAA DIII athletics. Our entire family is passionate about athletics, but we also love trips to the beach and playing Nerf capture the flag. I look forward to working together!

https://svu.edu/admissions	p			Originally from Salt Lake City, I have lived in Buena Vista and been involved with Southern Virginia University for about a decade. I love this University and everything I’ve been able to do here. I graduated in business and creative writing, but also performed in theater and comedy improv, sung in a cappella and choir, competed in soccer, and served in the student executive council. The opportunity to be involved with so many things I love while studying in multiple disciplines is the reason I chose Southern Virginia. I feel lucky to help others have that same experience.

It’s both an honor and a joy to get to share my excitement about the University with students every day. Originally from California, I majored in English with minors in creative writing and editing at Brigham Young University. I appreciate a truly awful pun, and I love motorcycle rides with my husband along the Blue Ridge Parkway. My respective passions for the outdoors and for ice cream are
