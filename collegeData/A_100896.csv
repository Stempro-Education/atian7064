http://www.lsus.edu/lsus-50th-anniversary-site	p			Welcome friends and family of LSUS to our 50th Anniversary Celebration website. This celebration marks a joyous time for LSUS, not merely because we as a campus have been here for 50 years, but that we have been able to serve and educate thousands of students who have gone on to make an important mark in society. Today, we celebrate not just our longevity as a campus, but those alums who have gone forward taking our name and being standard bearers of the education we provide. The coming year will be filled with events that we hope not only our current students will participate in, but also those who have been with us in the past and those who will join us in the future. LSUS loves our Shreveport-Bossier community and want each of you to feel welcome to come and participate in the activities and events that highlight why LSUS is your university.

http://www.lsus.edu/lsus-50th-anniversary-site	li			An afterschool program that began almost ten years ago at LSUS is still showing its positive effect on students, and the community. Dr. Kevin Jones founded the School of R.O.C.K (Reading and Organization for Cool Kids) program at Miami University in Ohio in 2005. During the programâs first year, it was called âExtreme Makeover in Readingâ. Dr. Jones saw the impact of the program on students at Miami University, and began the program at LSUS in 2009, upon moving to Shreveport.

Since then, LSUS Greek life has grown to eight active sororities and fraternities.
