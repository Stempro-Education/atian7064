https://www.washington.edu/rules	h1			University Policy and Rules Office
https://www.washington.edu/rules	p			The University Policy and Rules Office oversees the University’s rule-making process, including the review, creation, amendment, and repeal of the UW’s Washington Administrative Code rules (Title 478 WAC). In carrying out this function, the office works with the UW unit promulgating the rule, the Attorney General’s Office, and the Office of the Board of Regents for final adoption. In addition, the office maintains the UW rule-making docket, plans and facilitates public hearings, produces the required legal notices for the press, and publishes the WAC chapter links in the UW Policy Directory.
https://www.washington.edu/rules	p		em	The University Policy and Rules Office also coordinates policy codification, reviews and approvals, and publication of the 
https://www.washington.edu/rules	em			Administrative Policy Statements
