https://www.yale.edu/academics	p			A Yale education is not a narrow path that students follow from Point A to Point Z.
https://www.yale.edu/academics	p			We encourage our students to explore the academic landscape, venturing into unfamiliar fields of knowledge and, perhaps, discovering new passions that will take them in a different direction altogether. Along the way, faculty members help guide them, and fellow students offer diverse perspectives that can shed new light on the path. We also encourage our students to travel literally, by going abroad for study, research, or work.
https://www.yale.edu/academics	p			By nurturing this spirit of inquiry, Yale aims to prepare global citizens who are instilled with a life-long love of learning.
